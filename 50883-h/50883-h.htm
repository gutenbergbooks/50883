<h3>DOCUMENTARY SOURCES OF EARLY SPANISH-AMERICAN
HISTORY.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE earliest of the historians to use, to any extent, documentary proofs, was
Herrera, in his <i>Historia general</i>, first published in 1601.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As the official
historiographer of the Indies, he had the best of opportunities for access to the great
wealth of documents which the Spanish archivists had preserved; but he never distinctly
quotes them, or says where they are to be found.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is through him that we
are aware of some important manuscripts not now known to exist.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The formation of the collections at Simancas, near Valladolid, dates back to an
order of Charles the Fifth, Feb. 19, 1543. New accommodations were added from
time to time, as documents were removed thither from the bureaus of the Crown
Secretaries, and from those of the Councils of Seville and of the Indies. It was
reorganized by Philip II., in 1567, on a larger basis, as a depository for historical
research, when masses of manuscripts from other parts of Spain were transported
thither;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the comparatively small extent of the Simancas Collection does not
indicate that the order was very extensively observed; though it must be remembered
that Napoleon made havoc among these papers, and that in 1814 it was but
a remnant which was rearranged.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mii" id="Page_mii">[ii]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Robertson was the earliest of the English writers to make even scant use of
the original manuscript sources of information; and such documents as he got from
Spain were obtained through the solicitation and address of Lord Grantham, the
English ambassador. Everything, however, was grudgingly given, after being first
directly refused. It is well known that the Spanish Government considered even
what he did obtain and make use of as unfit to be brought to the attention of their
own public, and the authorities interposed to prevent the translation of Robertson’s
history into Spanish.</p>

<p>In his preface Dr. Robertson speaks of the peculiar solicitude with which the
Spanish archives were concealed from strangers in his time; and he tells how, to Spanish
subjects even, those of Simancas were opened only upon a royal order. Papers
notwithstanding such order, he says, could be copied only by payment of fees too exorbitant
to favor research.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> By order of Fernando VI., in the last century, a collection
of selected copies of the most important documents in the various depositories of
archives was made; and this was placed in the Biblioteca Nacional at Madrid.</p>

<p>In 1778 Charles III. ordered that the documents of the Indies in the Spanish
offices and depositories should be brought together in one place. The movement
did not receive form till 1785, when a commission was appointed; and not till
1788, did Simancas, and the other collections drawn upon, give up their treasures
to be transported to Seville, where they were placed in the building provided for
them.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Muñoz, who was born in 1745, was commissioned in 1779 by the King with
authority<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to search archives, public and family, and to write and publish a <i>Historia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_miii" id="Page_miii">[iii]</a></span>
del nuevo mundo</i>. Of this work only a single volume,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> bringing the story down to
1500, was completed, and it was issued in 1793. Muñoz gave in its preface a critical
review of the sources of his subject. In the prosecution of his labor he formed a
collection of documents, which after his death was scattered;
but parts of it were, in 1827, in the possession of
Don Antonio de Uguina,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and later of Ternaux. The
Spanish Government exerted itself to reassemble the fragments
of this collection, which is now, in great part, in the
Academy of History at Madrid,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> where it has been increased
by other manuscripts from the archives at Seville. Other
portions are lodged, however, in ministerial offices, and the
most interesting are noted by Harrisse in his <i>Christophe
Colomb</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> A paper by Mr. J. Carson Brevoort on Muñoz and his manuscripts is in
the <i>American Bibliopolist</i> (vol. viii. p. 21), February, 1876.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> An English translation
of Muñoz’s single volume appeared in 1797, with notes, mostly translated from the
German version by Sprengel, published in 1795. Rich had a manuscript copy
made of all that Muñoz wrote of his second volume (never printed), and this
copy is noted in the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 47.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“In the days of Muñoz,” says Harrisse in his <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 1, “the great
repositories for original documents concerning Columbus and the early history of
Spanish America were the Escurial, Simancas, the Convent of Monserrate, the colleges
of St. Bartholomew and Cuenca at Salamanca, and St. Gregory at Valladolid,
the Cathedral of Valencia, the Church of Sacro-Monte in Granada, the convents of
St. Francis at Tolosa, St. Dominick at Malaga, St. Acacio, St. Joseph, and St. Isidro
del Campo at Seville. There may be many valuable records still concealed in those
churches and convents.”</p>

<p>The originals of the letters-patent, and other evidences of privileges granted by the
Spanish monarchs to Columbus, were preserved by him, and now constitute a part
of the collection of the Duke of Veraguas, in Madrid. In 1502 Columbus caused
several attested copies of them and of a few other documents to be made, raising the
number of papers from thirty-six to forty-four. His care in causing these copies to
be distributed among different custodians evinces the high importance which he held
them to have, as testimonials to his fame and his prominence in the world’s history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_miv" id="Page_miv">[iv]</a></span>
One wishes he could have had a like solicitude for the exactness of his own statements.
Before setting out on his fourth voyage, he intrusted one of these copies to Francesco
di Rivarolo, for delivery to Nicoló Odérigo, the ambassador of Genoa, in Madrid.
From Cadiz shortly afterwards he sent a second copy to the same Odérigo. In 1670
both of these copies were given, by a descendant of Odérigo, to the Republic of Genoa.
They subsequently disappeared from the archives of the State, and Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has
recently found one of them in the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Paris.
The other was bought in 1816 by the Sardinian Government, at a sale of the effects
of Count Michael-Angelo Cambiasi. After a copy had been made and deposited in
the archives at Turin, this second copy was deposited in a marble custodia, surmounted
by a bust of Columbus, and placed in the palace of the Doges in Genoa.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> These
documents, with two of the letters addressed (March 21, 1502, and Dec. 27,
1504)<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to Odérigo, were published in Genoa in 1823 in the <i>Codice diplomatico
Colombo-Americano</i>, edited with a biographical introduction by Giovanni Battista
Spotorno.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A third letter (April 2, 1502), addressed to the governors of the Bank
of St. George, was not printed by Spotorno, but was given in English in 1851 in the
<i>Memorials of Columbus</i> by Robert Dodge, published by the Maryland Historical
Society.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The State Archives of Genoa were transferred from the Ducal Palace, in 1817,
to the Palazzetto, where they now are; and Harrisse’s account<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of them tells us what
they do not contain respecting Columbus, rather than what they do. We also learn
from him something of the “Archives du Notariat Génois,” and of the collections
formed by the Senator Federico Federici (d. 1647), by Gian Battista Richeri (<i>circa</i>
1724), and by others; but they seem to have afforded Harrisse little more than stray
notices of early members of the Colombo family.</p>

<p>Washington Irving refers to the “self-sustained zeal of one of the last veterans
of Spanish literature, who is almost alone, yet indefatigable, in his labors in a country
where at present literary exertion meets with but little excitement or reward.”
Such is his introduction of Martin Fernandez de Navarrete,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> who was born in 1765,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mv" id="Page_mv">[v]</a></span>
and as a young man gave some active and meritorious service in the Spanish navy.
In 1789 he was forced by ill-health to abandon the sea. He then accepted a commission
from Charles IV. to examine all the depositories of documents in the kingdom,
and arrange the material to be found in illustration of the history of the Spanish
navy.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This work he continued, with interruptions, till 1825, when he began at
Madrid the publication of his <i>Coleccion de los viages y descubrimientos que hicieron
por mar los Españoles desde fines del siglo XV.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> which reached an extent of five
volumes, and was completed in 1837. It put in convenient printed form more than
five hundred documents of great value, between the dates of 1393 and 1540. A
sixth and seventh volume were left unfinished at his death, which occurred in 1844,
at the age of seventy-eight.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> His son afterward gathered some of his minor writings,
including biographies of early navigators,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and printed (1848) them as a <i>Coleccion de
opúsculos</i>; and in 1851 another of his works, <i>Biblioteca maritima Española</i>, was
printed at Madrid in two volumes.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The first two volumes of his collection (of which volumes there was a second
edition in 1858) bore the distinctive title, <i>Relaciones, cartas y otros documentos, concernientes
á los cuatro viages que hizo el Almirante D. Cristóbal Colon para el descubrimiento
de las Indias occidentales, and Documentos diplomáticos</i>. Three years later
(1828) a French version of these two volumes appeared at Paris, which Navarrete
himself revised, and which is further enriched with notes by Humboldt, Jomard,
Walckenaer, and others.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This French edition is entitled: <i>Relation des quatres voyages
entrepris par Ch. Colomb pour la découverte du Nouveau Monde de 1492 à 1504,
traduite par Chalumeau de Vernéuil? et de la Roquette</i>. It is in three volumes, and is
worth about twenty francs. An Italian version, <i>Narrazione dei quattro viaggi</i>, etc.,
was made by F. Giuntini, and appeared in two volumes at Prato in 1840-1841.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Navarrete’s literary labors did not prevent much conspicuous service on his part,
both at sea and on land; and in 1823, not long before he published his great Collection,
he became the head of the Spanish hydrographic bureau.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> After his death the
Spanish Academy printed (1846) his historical treatise on the Art of Navigation
and kindred subjects (<i>Disertacion sobre la historia de la náutica</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>), which was an
enlargement of an earlier essay published in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mvi" id="Page_mvi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>While Navarrete’s great work was in progress at Madrid, Mr. Alexander H.
Everett, the American Minister at that Court, urged upon Washington Irving, then at
Bordeaux, the translation into English of the new material which Navarrete was preparing,
together with his Commentary. Upon this incentive Irving went to Madrid
and inspected the work, which was soon published. His sense of the popular demand
easily convinced him that a continuous narrative, based upon Navarrete’s material,&mdash;but
leaving himself free to use all other helps,&mdash;would afford him better opportunities
to display his own graceful literary skill, and more readily to engage the favor
of the general reader. Irving’s judgment was well founded; and Navarrete never
quite forgave him for making a name more popularly associated with that of the great
discoverer than his own.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Navarrete afforded Irving at this time much personal
help and encouragement. Obadiah Rich, the American Consul at Valencia, under
whose roof Irving lived, furnished him, however, his chief resource in a curious
and extensive library. To the Royal Library, and to that of the Jesuit College of
San Isidro, Irving also occasionally resorted. The Duke of Veraguas took pleasure
in laying before him his own family archives.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The result was the <i>Life and Voyages
of Christopher Columbus</i>; and in the Preface, dated at Madrid in 1827,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Irving made
full acknowledgment of the services which had been rendered to him. This work
was followed, not long after, by the <i>Voyages and Discoveries of the Companions of
Columbus</i>; and ever since, in English and other languages, the two books have kept
constant company.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Irving proved an amiable hero-worshipper, and Columbus was pictured with few
questionable traits. The writer’s literary canons did not call for the scrutiny which
destroys a world’s exemplar. “One of the most salutary purposes of history,” he
says, “is to furnish examples of what human genius and laudable enterprise may
accomplish,”&mdash;and such brilliant examples must be rescued from the “pernicious
erudition” of the investigator. Irving’s method at least had the effect to
conciliate the upholders of the saintly character of the discoverer; and the modern
school of the De Lorgues, who have been urging the canonization of Columbus, find
Irving’s ideas of him higher and juster than those of Navarrete.</p>

<p class="p2">Henri Ternaux-Compans printed his <i>Voyages, relations, et mémoires originaux
pour servir à l’histoire de la dècouverte de l’Amérique</i>, between 1837 and 1841.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mvii" id="Page_mvii">[vii]</a></span>
This collection included rare books and about seventy-five original documents, which
it is suspected may have been obtained during the French occupation of Spain.
Ternaux published his <i>Archives des voyages</i>, in two volumes, at Paris in 1840;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> a
minor part of it pertains to American affairs. Another volume, published at the same
time, is often found with it,&mdash;<i>Recueil de documents et mémoires originaux sur l’histoire
des possessions Espagnoles dans l’Amérique</i>, whose contents, it is said, were derived
from the Muñoz Collection.</p>

<p>The Academy of History at Madrid began in 1842 a series of documentary illustrations
which, though devoted to the history of Spain in general (<i>Coleccion de documentos
inéditos para la historia de España</i>), contains much matter of the first importance
in respect to the history of her colonies.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Navarrete was one of the original
editors, but lived only to see five volumes published. Salvá, Baranda, and others
have continued the publication since, which now amounts to eighty volumes, of which
vols. 62, 63, and 64 are the famous history of Las Casas, then for the first time put
in print.</p>

<p>In 1864 a new series was begun at Madrid,&mdash;<i>Coleccion de documentos inéditos relativos
al descubrimiento, conquista y colonizacion de las posesiones Españolas en América
y Oceania, sacados, en su mayor parte, del Real Archivo de Indias</i>. Nearly forty
volumes have thus far been published, under the editing of Joaquin F. Pacheco, Francisco
de Cárdenas, and Luis Torres de Mendoza at the start, but with changes later
in the editorial staff.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Mr. E. G. Squier edited at New York in 1860 a work called <i>Collection of Rare
and Original Documents and Relations concerning the Discovery and Conquest of
America, chiefly from the Spanish Archives, in the original, with Translations, Notes,
Maps, and Sketches</i>. There was a small edition only,&mdash;one hundred copies on small
paper, and ten on large paper.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This was but one of a large collection of manuscripts
relative to Central America and Mexico which Mr. Squier had collected, partly during
his term as <i>chargé d’affaires</i> in 1849. Out of these he intended a series of publications,
which never went beyond this first number. The collection “consists,” says
Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> “of extracts and copies of letters and reports of <i>audiencias</i>, governors,
bishops, and various governmental officials, taken from the Spanish archives at Madrid
and from the library of the Spanish Royal Academy of History, mostly under the

enough to gather from the Archivo General de Indias in the Lonja at Seville, which
contains as many as forty-seven thousand huge packages, brought, within the last fifty
years, from all parts of Spain. But the richest mine as yet unexplored we suppose
to be the archives of the monastic orders in Italy; as all the expeditions to the New
World were accompanied by Franciscan, Dominican, Benedictine, and other monks,
who maintained an active correspondence with the heads of their respective congregations.
The private archives of the Dukes of Veraguas, Medina-Sidonia, and Del
Infantado, at Madrid, are very rich. There is scarce anything relating to that early
period left in Simancas; but the original documents in the Torre do Tombo at
Lisbon are all intact”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">COLUMBUS AND HIS DISCOVERIES.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY JUSTIN WINSOR,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>The Editor.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap06">BEYOND his birth, of poor and respectable parents, we know nothing
positively about the earliest years of Columbus. His father was
probably a wool-comber. The boy had the ordinary schooling of his
time, and a touch of university life during a few months passed at Pavia;
then at fourteen he chose to become a sailor. A seaman’s career in
those days implied adventures more or less of a piratical kind. There are
intimations, however, that in the intervals of this exciting life he followed
the more humanizing occupation of selling books in Genoa, and perhaps
got some employment in the making of charts, for he had a deft hand at
design. We know his brother Bartholomew was earning his living in this
way when Columbus joined him in Lisbon in 1470. Previous to this there
seems to be some degree of certainty in connecting him with voyages
made by a celebrated admiral of his time bearing the same family name,
Colombo; he is also said to have joined the naval expedition of John of
Anjou against Naples in 1459.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Again, he may have been the companion
of another notorious corsair, a nephew of the one already mentioned, as is
sometimes maintained; but this sea-rover’s proper name seems to have been
more likely Caseneuve, though he was sometimes called Coulon or Colon.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Columbus spent the years 1470-1484 in Portugal. It was a time
when the air was filled with tales of discovery. The captains of Prince
Henry of Portugal had been gradually pushing their ships down the African
coast and in some of these voyages Columbus was a participant. To
one of his navigators Prince Henry had given the governorship of the
Island of Porto Santo, of the Madeira group. To the daughter of this
man, Perestrello,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Columbus was married; and with his widow Columbus
lived, and derived what advantage he could from the papers and charts
of the old navigator. There was a tie between his own and his wife’s
family in the fact that Perestrello was an Italian, and seems to have been
of good family, but to have left little or no inheritance for his daughter
beyond some property in Porto Santo, which Columbus went to enjoy.
On this island Columbus’ son Diego was born in 1474.</p>

<p>It was in this same year (1474) that he had some correspondence with
the Italian <i>savant</i>, Toscanelli, regarding the discovery of land westward.
A belief in such discovery was a natural corollary of the object which
Prince Henry had had in view,&mdash;by circumnavigating Africa to find a way
to the countries of which Marco Polo had given golden accounts. It was
to substitute for the tedious indirection of the African route a direct western
passage,&mdash;a belief in the practicability of which was drawn from a confidence
in the sphericity of the earth. Meanwhile, gathering what hope he could
by reading the ancients, by conferring with wise men, and by questioning
mariners returned from voyages which had borne them more or less westerly
on the great ocean, Columbus suffered the thought to germinate as it
would in his mind for several years. Even on the voyages which he made
hither and thither for gain,&mdash;once far north, to Iceland even, or perhaps
only to the Faröe Islands, as is inferred,&mdash;and in active participation in
various warlike and marauding expeditions, like the attack on the Venetian
galleys near Cape St. Vincent in 1485,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> he constantly came in contact with
those who could give him hints affecting his theory. Through all these
years, however, we know not certainly what were the vicissitudes which fell
to his lot.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>It seems possible, if not probable, that Columbus went to Genoa and
Venice, and in the first instance presented his scheme of western exploration
to the authorities of those cities.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> He may, on the other hand; have
tried earlier to get the approval of the King of Portugal. In this case
the visit to Italy may have occurred in the year following his departure
from Portugal, which is nearly a blank in the record of his life. De Lorgues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
believes in the anterior Italian visit, when both Genoa and Venice rejected
his plans; and then makes him live with his father at Savone, gaining a
living by constructing charts, and by selling maps and books in Genoa.</p>

<p>It would appear that in 1484 Columbus had urged his views upon the
Portuguese King, but with no further success than to induce the sovereign
to despatch, on other pretences, a vessel to undertake the passage westerly in
secrecy. Its return without accomplishing any discovery opened the eyes
of Columbus to the deceit which that monarch would have put upon him,
and he departed from the Portuguese dominions in not a little disgust.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The death of his wife had severed another tie with Portugal; and taking
with him his boy Diego, Columbus left, to go we scarcely know whither, so
obscure is the record of his life for the next year. Muñoz claims for this
period that he went to Italy. Sharon Turner has conjectured that he went
to England; but there seems no ground to believe that he had any relations
with the English Court except by deputy, for his brother Bartholomew
was despatched to lay his schemes before Henry VII.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Whatever may
have been the result of this application, no answer seems to have reached
Columbus until he was committed to the service of Spain.</p>

<p>It was in 1485 or 1486&mdash;for authorities differ<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>&mdash;that a proposal was
laid by Columbus before Ferdinand and Isabella; but the steps were slow
by which he made even this progress. We know how, in the popular story,
he presented himself at the Franciscan Convent of Santa María de la
Rábida, asking for bread for himself and his boy. This convent stood on
a steep promontory about half a league from Palos, and was then in charge
of the Father Superior Juan Perez de Marchena.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The appearance of the
stranger first, and his talk next, interested the Prior; and it was under his
advice and support after a while&mdash;when Martin Alonzo Pinzon, of the
neighboring town of Palos, had espoused the new theory&mdash;that Columbus
was passed on to Cordova, with such claims to recognition as the Prior of
Rabidá could bestow upon him.</p>

<p>It was perhaps while success did not seem likely here, in the midst of
the preparations for a campaign against the Moorish kings, that his brother
Bartholomew made his trip to England.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It was also in November, 1486, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
would seem, that Columbus formed his connection with Beatrix Enriquez,
while he was waiting in Cordova for the attention of the monarch to be
disengaged from this Moorish campaign.</p>

<p>Among those at this time attached to the Court of Ferdinand and Isabella
was Alexander Geraldinus, then about thirty years old. He was a
traveller, a man of letters, and a mathematician; and it was afterward the
boast of his kinsman, who edited his <i>Itinerarium ad regiones sub æquinoctiali
plaga constitutas</i><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> (Rome, 1631), that Geraldinus, in one way and
another, aided Columbus in pressing
his views upon their Majesties. It
was through Geraldinus’ influence, or
through that of others who had become
impressed with his views, that
Columbus finally got the ear of Pedro
Gonzales de Mendoza, Archbishop
of Toledo. The way was now surer.
The King heeded the Archbishop’s
advice, and a council of learned men
was convened, by royal orders, at
Salamanca, to judge Columbus and
his theories. Here he was met by
all that prejudice, content, and ignorance
(as now understood, but wisdom
then) could bring to bear, in the shape
of Scriptural contradictions of his
views, and the pseudo-scientific distrust
of what were thought mere visionary
aims. He met all to his own
satisfaction, but not quite so successfully
to the comprehension of his
judges. He told them that he should
find Asia that way; and that if he
did not, there must be other lands
westerly quite as desirable to discover.
No conclusion had been reached when, in the spring of 1487, the
Court departed from Cordova, and Columbus found himself left behind
without encouragement, save in the support of a few whom he had convinced,&mdash;notably
Diego de Deza, a friar destined to some ecclesiastical
distinction as Archbishop of Seville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>During the next five years Columbus experienced every vexation attendant
upon delay, varied by participancy in the wars which the Court urged
against the Moors, and in which he sought to propitiate the royal powers
by doing them good service in the field. At last, in 1491, wearied with
excuses of pre-occupation and the ridicule of the King’s advisers, Columbus
turned his back on the Court and left Seville,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> to try his fortune with some
of the Grandees. He still urged in vain, and sought again the Convent of
Rabida. Here he made a renewed impression upon Marchena; so that
finally, through the Prior’s interposition with Isabella, Columbus was summoned
to Court. He arrived in time to witness the surrender of Granada,
and to find the monarchs more at liberty to listen to his words. There
seemed now a likelihood of reaching an end of his tribulations; when his
demand of recognition as viceroy, and his claim to share one tenth of
all income from the territories to be discovered, frightened as well as disgusted
those appointed to negotiate with him, and all came once more
to an end. Columbus mounted his mule and started for France. Two
finance ministers of the Crown, Santangel for Arragon and Quintanilla
for Castile, had been sufficiently impressed by the new theory to look with
regret on what they thought might be a lost opportunity. Isabella was
won; and a messenger was despatched to overtake Columbus.</p>

<p>The fugitive returned; and on April 17, 1492, at Santa Fé, an agreement
was signed by Ferdinand and Isabella which gave Columbus the office of
high-admiral and viceroy in parts to be discovered, and an income of one
eighth of the profits, in consideration of his assuming one eighth of the
costs. Castile bore the rest of the expense; but Arragon advanced the
money,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and the Pinzons subscribed the eighth part for Columbus.</p>

<p>The happy man now solemnly vowed to use what profits should accrue
in accomplishing the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre from the Moslems.
Palos, owing some duty to the Crown, was ordered to furnish two armed
caravels, and Columbus was empowered to fit out a third. On the 30th
of April the letters-patent confirming his dignities were issued. His son
Diego was made a page of the royal household. On May 12 he left
the Court and hastened towards Palos. Here, upon showing his orders
for the vessels, he found the town rebellious, with all the passion of a
people who felt that some of their number were being simply doomed
to destruction beyond that Sea of Darkness whose bounds they knew
not. Affairs were in this unsatisfactory condition when the brothers
Pinzon threw themselves and their own vessels into the cause; while a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
third vessel, the “Pinta,” was impressed,&mdash;much to the alarm of its
owners and crew.</p>

151. In the variety of changes in methods of
measurement it is not easy to find the equivalent
in tonnage of the present day for the ships of
Columbus’s time. Those constituting his little
fleet seem to have been light and swift vessels
of the class called caravels. One had a deck
amidships, with high forecastle and poop, and
two were without this deck, though high, and
covered at the ends. Captain G. V. Fox has
given what he supposes were the dimensions
of the larger one,&mdash;a heavier craft and duller
sailer than the others. He calculates for a
hundred tons,&mdash;makes her sixty-three feet over
all, fifty-one feet keel, twenty feet beam, and ten
and a half feet draft of water. She carried the
kind of gun termed lombards, and a crew of
fifty men. <i>U. S. Coast Survey Report</i>, 1880, app.

<p>And so, out of the harbor of Palos,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> on the 3d of August, 1492, Columbus
sailed with his three little vessels. The “Santa Maria,” which carried his
flag, was the only one of the three which had a deck, while the other two,
the “Niña” and the “Pinta,” were open caravels. The two Pinzons commanded
these smaller ships,&mdash;Martin Alonzo the “Pinta”, and Vicente
the “Niña.”</p>

<p>The voyage was uneventful, except that the expectancy of all quickened
the eye, which sometimes saw over-much, and poised the mind, which was
alert with hope and fear. It has been pointed out how a westerly course
from Palos would have discouraged Columbus with head and variable winds.
Running down to the Canaries (for Toscanelli put those islands in the latitude
of Cipango), a westerly course thence would bring him within the continuous
easterly trade-winds, whose favoring influence would inspirit his
men,&mdash;as, indeed, was the case. Columbus, however, was very glad on the
22d of September to experience a west wind, just to convince his crew it
was possible to have, now and then, the direction of it favorable to their
return. He had proceeded, as he thought, some two hundred miles farther
than the longitude in which he had conjectured Cipango to be, when the
urging of Martin Alonzo Pinzon, and the flight of birds indicating land
to be nearer in the southwest, induced him to change his course in that
direction.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>With the rest of his company and in his two smaller vessels, on the 4th of
January, 1493, Columbus started on his return to Spain. He ran northerly to
the latitude of his destination,
and then steered
due east. He experienced
severe weather,
but reached the Azores
safely; and then, passing
on, entered the
Tagus and had an interview
with the Portuguese
King. Leaving
Lisbon on the 13th, he
reached Palos on the
15th of March, after an
absence of over seven
months.</p>

<p>He was received by
the people of the little
seaport with acclamations
and wonder; and, despatching a messenger to the Spanish Court at
Barcelona, he proceeded to Seville to await the commands of the monarchs.
He was soon
bidden to hasten to
them; and with the triumph
of more than a
conqueror, and preceded
by the bedizened
Indians whom he had
brought with him, he
entered the city and
stood in the presence of
the sovereigns. He
was commanded to sit
before them, and to tell
the story of his discovery.
This he did with
conscious pride; and
not forgetting the past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he publicly renewed his previous vow to wrest the Holy Sepulchre from
the Infidel.</p>

         <p class="pf400">This is a reduction of a fac-simile by Pilinski,
given in Margry’s <i>Les Navigations Françaises</i>,
p. 360,&mdash;an earlier reproduction having
been given by M. Jal in <i>La France maritime</i>. It
is also figured in Charton’s <i>Voyageurs</i>, iii. 139.
The original sketch, by Columbus himself, was
sent by him from Seville in 1502, and is preserved
in the city hall at Genoa. M. Jal gives
a description of it in his <i>De Paris à Naples</i>, 1836,
i. 257. The figure sitting beside Columbus is
Providence; Envy and Ignorance are hinted at
as monsters following in his wake; while Constancy,
Tolerance, the Christian Religion, Victory,
and Hope attend him. Above all is the
floating figure of Fame blowing two trumpets,
one marked “Genoa,” the other “Fama Columbi.”
Harrisse (<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 165)
says that good judges assign this picture to
Columbus’s own hand, though none of the drawings
ascribed to him are authentic beyond doubt;
while it is very true that he had the reputation
of being a good draughtsman. Feuillet de Conches
(<i>Revue contemporaine</i>, xxiv. 509) disbelieves
in its authenticity. The usual signature of Columbus
is in the lower left-hand corner of the
above sketch, the initial letters in which have
never been satisfactorily interpreted; but perhaps
as reasonable a guess as any would make
them stand for “<span class="smcap">Servus supplex Altissimi
Salvatoris&mdash;Christus, Maria, Yoseph</span>&mdash;<i>Christo
ferens</i>.” Others read, “<span class="smcap">Servidor sus
Altezas sacras, Christo, Maria, Ysabel</span>
[<i>or</i> <span class="smcap">Yoseph</span>].” The “Christo ferens” is sometimes
replaced by “<i>El Almirante</i>.” The essay
on the autograph in the <i>Cartas de Indias</i> is
translated in the <i>Magazine of American History</i>,
Jan., 1883, p. 55. Cf. Irving, app. xxxv. Ruge,

<p>The expectation which had sustained Columbus in his voyage, and
which he thought his discoveries had confirmed, was that he had reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the western parts of India or Asia; and the new islands were accordingly
everywhere spoken of as the West Indies, or the New World.</p>

<p>The ruling Pope, Alexander VI., was a native Valencian; and to him an

thither side of which Spain was to be master; and on the hither side, Portugal.
This was traced at a meridian one hundred leagues west of the Azores
and Cape de Verde Islands, which were assumed to be in the same longitude
practically. The thought of future complications from the running
of this line to the antipodes does not seem to have alarmed either Pope
or sovereigns; but troubles on the Atlantic side were soon to arise, to
be promptly compounded by a convention at Tordesillas, which agreed
(June 4, ratified June 7, 1494) to move the meridian line to a point three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>

<p>Columbus and
the destined colonists sailed from Cadiz on the 25th of September. The
ships sighted an island
on the 3d of November,
and continuing their
course among the Caribbee
Islands, they finally
reached La Navidad,
and found it a waste. It
was necessary, however,
to make a beginning
somewhere; and a little
to the east of the ruined
fort they landed their
supplies and began the
laying out of a city,
which they called Isabella.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Expeditions were
sent inland to find gold.
The explorers reported
success. Twelve of the
ships were sent home with Indians who had been seized; and these ships
were further laden with products of the soil which had been gathered.
Columbus himself went with four hundred
men to begin work at the interior mines; but
the natives, upon whom he had counted for
labor, had begun to fear enslavement for this
purpose, and kept aloof. So mining did not
flourish. Disease, too, was working evil.
Columbus himself had been prostrated; but
he was able to conduct three caravels westward,
when he discovered Jamaica. On this
expedition he made up his mind that Cuba
was a part of the Asiatic main, and somewhat unadvisedly forced his men
to sign a paper declaring their own belief to the same purport.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Returning to his colony, the Admiral found that all was not going well.
He had not himself inspired confidence as a governor, and his fame as an
explorer was fast being eclipsed by his misfortunes as a ruler. Some of
his colonists, accompanied by the papal vicar, had seized ships and set sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
for home. The natives, emboldened by the cruelties practised upon them,
were laying siege to his fortified posts. As an offset, however, his brother
Bartholomew had arrived from Spain with three store-ships; and later
came Antonio de Torres with four other ships, which in due time were
sent back to carry some samples of gold and a cargo of natives to be sold
as slaves. The vessels had brought tidings of the charges preferred at
Court against the Admiral, and his brother Diego was sent back with
the ships to answer
these charges in the
Admiral’s behalf. Unfortunately
Diego was
not a man of strong
character, and his advocacy
was not of the
best.</p>

<p>In March (1495) Columbus
conducted an
expedition into the interior
to subdue and
hold tributary the native
population. It was
cruelly done, as the
world looks upon such
transactions to-day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Spain
reiteration of charges
was beginning to shake the confidence of his sovereigns; and Juan
Aguado, a friend of Columbus, was sent to investigate. He reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Isabella in October,&mdash;Diego, the Admiral’s brother, accompanying him.
Aguado did not find affairs reassuring; and when he returned to Spain
with his report in March (1496), Columbus thought it best to go too, and to
make his excuses or explanations in person. They reached Cadiz in June,
just as Niño was sailing with three caravels to the new colony.</p>

<p>Ferdinand and Isabella received him kindly, gave him new honors, and
promised him other outfits. Enthusiasm, however, had died out, and delays
took place. The reports of the returning ships did not correspond
with the pictures of Marco Polo, and the new-found world was thought to
be a very poor India after all. Most people were of this mind; though
Columbus was not disheartened, and the public treasury was readily opened
for a third voyage.</p>

people are thus naked, handsome, brown, well-shaped

covered with feathers. The men also have
many precious stones on their faces and breasts.
No one else has anything, but all things are
in common. And the men have as wives those
who please them, be they mothers, sisters, or
friends; therein make they no distinction. They
also fight with each other; they also eat each
other, even those who are slain, and hang the
flesh of them in the smoke. They become a

<p>Coronel sailed early in 1498 with two ships, and Columbus followed with
six, embarking at San Lucar on the 30th of May. He now discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Trinidad (July 31), which he named either from its three peaks, or from
the Holy Trinity; struck the northern coast of South America,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and skirted
what was later known as the Pearl coast, going as far as the Island of
Margarita. He wondered at the roaring fresh waters which the Orinoco
pours into the Gulf of Pearls, as he called it, and he half believed that its
exuberant tide came from the terrestrial paradise.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He touched the southern
coast of Hayti on the 30th of August. Here already his colonists had
established a fortified post, and founded the town of Santo Domingo. His
brother Bartholomew had ruled energetically during the Admiral’s absence,
but he had not prevented a revolt, which was headed by Roldan. Columbus
on his arrival found the insurgents still defiant, but was able after a
while to reconcile them, and he even succeeded in attaching Roldan warmly
to his interests.</p>

<p>Columbus’ absence from Spain, however, left his good name without
sponsors; and to satisfy detractors, a new commissioner was sent over with
enlarged powers, even with authority to supersede Columbus in general
command, if necessary. This emissary was Francisco de Bobadilla, who
arrived at Santo Domingo with two caravels on the 23d of August, 1500, finding
Diego in command, his brother the Admiral being absent. An issue
was at once made. Diego refused to accede to the commissioner’s orders
till Columbus returned to judge the case himself; so Bobadilla assumed
charge of the Crown property violently, took possession of the Admiral’s
house, and when Columbus returned, he with his brother was arrested and
put in irons. In this condition the prisoners were placed on shipboard,
and sailed for Spain. The captain of the ship offered to remove the manacles;
but Columbus would not permit it, being determined to land in
Spain bound as he was; and so he did. The effect of his degradation was
to his advantage; sovereigns and people were shocked at the sight; and
Ferdinand and Isabella hastened to make amends by receiving him with
renewed favor. It was soon apparent that everything reasonable would
be granted him by the monarchs, and that he could have all he might wish,
short of receiving a new lease of power in the islands, which the sovereigns
were determined to see pacified at least before Columbus should
again assume government of them. The Admiral had not forgotten his
vow to wrest the Holy Sepulchre from the Infidel; but the monarchs did
not accede to his wish to undertake it. Disappointed in this, he proposed
a new voyage; and getting the royal countenance for this scheme, he was
supplied with four vessels of from fifty to seventy tons each,&mdash;the “Capitana,”
the “Santiago de Palos,” the “Gallego,” and the “Vizcaino.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sailed from Cadiz May 9, 1502, accompanied by his brother Bartholomew
and his son Fernando. The vessels reached San Domingo June 29.</p>

<p>Bobadilla, whose rule of a year and a half had been an unhappy one,
had given place to Nicholás de Ovando; and the fleet which brought the
new governor,&mdash;with Maldonado, Las Casas, and others,&mdash;now lay in the
harbor waiting to receive Bobadilla for the return voyage. Columbus had
been instructed to avoid Hispaniola; but now that one of his vessels leaked,
and he needed to make repairs, he sent a boat ashore, asking permission to
enter the harbor. He was refused, though a storm was impending. He
sheltered his vessels as best he could, and rode out the gale. The fleet
which had on board Bobadilla and Roldan, with their ill-gotten gains,
was wrecked, and these enemies of Columbus were drowned. The Admiral
found a small harbor where he could make his repairs; and then, July 14,
sailed westward to find, as he supposed, the richer portions of India in
exchange for the barbarous outlying districts which others had appropriated
to themselves. He went on through calm and storm, giving names to
islands,&mdash;which later explorers re-named, and spread thereby confusion on
the early maps. He began to find more intelligence in the natives of these
islands than those of Cuba had betrayed, and got intimations of lands
still farther west, where copper and gold were in abundance. An old
Indian made them a rough map of the main shore. Columbus took him
on board, and proceeding onward a landing was made on the coast of Honduras
August 14. Three days later the explorers landed again fifteen
leagues farther east, and took possession of the country for Spain. Still
east they went; and, in gratitude for safety after a long storm, they named
a cape which they rounded Gracias á Dios,&mdash;a name still preserved at the
point where the coast of Honduras begins to trend southward. Columbus
was now lying ill on his bed, placed on deck, and was half the time in
revery. Still the vessels coasted south. They lost a boat’s crew in getting
water at one place; and tarrying near the mouth of the Rio San Juan,
they thought they got from the signs of the natives intelligence of a rich
and populous country over the mountains inland, where the men wore
clothes and bore weapons of steel, and the women were decked with corals
and pearls. These stories were reassuring; but the exorcising incantations
of the natives were quite otherwise for the superstitious among the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>They were now on the shores of Costa Rica, where the coast trends
southeast; and both the rich foliage and the gold plate on the necks of
the savages enchanted the explorers. They went on towards the source
of this wealth, as they fancied. The natives began to show some signs
of repulsion; but a few hawk’s-bells beguiled them, and gold plates were
received in exchange for the trinkets. The vessels were now within the
southernmost loop of the shore, and a bit of stone wall seemed to the
Spaniards a token of civilization. The natives called a town hereabouts
Veragua,&mdash;whence, years after, the descendants of Columbus borrowed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ducal title of his line. In this region Columbus dallied, not suspecting
how thin the strip of country was which separated him from the great
ocean whose farther waves washed his desired India. Then, still pursuing
the coast, which now turned to the northeast, he reached Porto Bello, as
we call it, where he found houses and orchards. Tracking the Gulf side
of the Panama isthmus, he encountered storms that forced him into harbors,
which continued to disclose the richness of the country.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>It became now apparent that they had reached the farthest spot of
Bastidas’ exploring, who had, in 1501, sailed westward along the northern
coast of South America. Amid something like mutinous cries from the
sailors, Columbus was fain to turn back to the neighborhood of Veragua,
where the gold was; but on arriving there, the seas, lately so fair, were
tumultuous, and the Spaniards were obliged to repeat the gospel of Saint
John to keep a water-spout, which they saw, from coming their way,&mdash;so
Fernando says in his Life of the Admiral. They finally made a harbor at
the mouth of the River Belen, and began to traffic with the natives, who
proved very cautious and evasive when inquiries were made respecting gold-mines.
Bartholomew explored the neighboring Veragua River in armed
boats, and met the chief of the region, with retainers, in a fleet of canoes.
Gold and trinkets were exchanged, as usual, both here and later on the
Admiral’s deck. Again Bartholomew led another expedition, and getting
the direction&mdash;a purposely false one, as it proved&mdash;from the chief in his
own village, he went to a mountain, near the abode of an enemy of the
chief, and found gold,&mdash;scant, however, in quantity compared with that
of the crafty chief’s own fields. The inducements were sufficient, however,
as Columbus thought, to found a colony; but before he got ready
to leave it, he suspected the neighboring chief was planning offensive
operations. An expedition was accordingly sent to seize the chief, and
he was captured in his own village; and so suddenly that his own people
could not protect him. The craft of the savage, however, stood him in
good stead; and while one of the Spaniards was conveying him down the
river in a boat, he jumped overboard and disappeared, only to reappear,
a few days later, in leading an attack on the Spanish camp. In this the
Indians were repulsed; but it was the beginning of a kind of lurking warfare
that disheartened the Spaniards. Meanwhile Columbus, with the ship,
was outside the harbor’s bar buffeting the gales. The rest of the prisoners
who had been taken with the chief were confined in his forecastle. By
concerted action some of them got out and jumped overboard, while those
not so fortunate killed themselves. As soon as the storm was over, Columbus
withdrew the colonists and sailed away. He abandoned one worm-eaten
caravel at Porto Bello, and, reaching Jamaica, beached two others.</p>

<p>A year of disappointment, grief, and want followed. Columbus clung
to his wrecked vessels. His crew alternately mutinied at his side, and roved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
about the island. Ovando, at Hispaniola, heard of his straits, but only
tardily and scantily relieved him. The discontented were finally humbled;
and some ships, despatched by the Admiral’s agent in Santo Domingo, at
last reached him, and brought him and his companions to that place,
where Ovando received him with ostentatious kindness, lodging him in his
house till Columbus departed for Spain, Sept. 12, 1504.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November the Admiral reached the harbor of San Lucar.
Weakness and disease later kept him in bed in Seville, and to his letters
of appeal the King paid little attention. He finally recovered sufficiently
to go to the Court at Segovia, in May, 1505; but Ferdinand&mdash;Isabella
had died Nov. 26, 1504&mdash;gave him scant courtesy. With a fatalistic
iteration, which had been his error in life, Columbus insisted still on
the rights which a better skill in governing might have saved for him;
and Ferdinand, with a dread of continued maladministration, as constantly
evaded the issue. While still hope was deferred, the infirmities of age and
a life of hardships brought Columbus to his end; and on Ascension Day,
the 20th of May, 1506,
he died, with his son
Diego and a few devoted

<p>The character of Columbus
is not difficult to
discern. If his mental
and moral equipoise had
been as true, and his
judgment as clear, as his
spirit was lofty and impressive,
he could have
controlled the actions of
men as readily as he
subjected their imaginations
to his will, and
more than one brilliant
opportunity for a record befitting a ruler of men would not have been
lost. The world always admires constancy and zeal; but when it is fed,
not by well-rounded performance, but by self-satisfaction and self-interest,
and tarnished by deceit, we lament where we would approve. Columbus’
imagination was eager, and unfortunately ungovernable. It led
him to a great discovery, which he was not seeking for; and he was far
enough right to make his error more emphatic. He is certainly not alone
among the great men of the world’s regard who have some of the attributes
of the small and mean.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><a name="c24" id="c24">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p>It would appear, from documents printed by Navarrete, that in 1470 Columbus was
brooding on the idea of land to the west. It is not at all probable that he would
himself have been able to trace from germ to flower the conception which finally possessed
his mind.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The age was ripened for it; and the finding of Brazil in 1500 by Cabral
showed how by an accident the theory might have become a practical result at any time
after the sailors of Europe had dared to take long ocean voyages. Columbus grew to
imagine that he had been independent of the influences of his time; and in a manuscript
in his own hand, preserved in the Colombina Library at Seville, he shows the weak, almost
irresponsible, side of his mind, and flouts at the grounds of reasonable progress which
many others besides himself had been making to a belief in the feasibility of a western passage.
In this unfortunate writing he declares that under inspiration he simply accomplished
the prophecy of Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> This assertion has not prevented saner and later writers<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> from
surveying the evidences of the growth of the belief in the mind, not of Columbus only, but
of others whom he may have impressed, and by whom he may have been influenced. The
new intuition was but the result of intellectual reciprocity. It needed a daring exponent,
and found one.</p>

<p>The geographical ideas which bear on this question depend, of course, upon the
sphericity of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This was entertained by the leading cosmographical thinkers
of that age,&mdash;who were far however from being in accord in respect to the size of the
globe. Going back to antiquity, Aristotle and Strabo had both taught in their respective
times the spherical theory; but they too were widely divergent upon the question of size,&mdash;Aristotle’s
ball being but mean in comparison with that of Strabo, who was not far wrong
when he contended that the world then known was something more than one third of the
actual circumference of the whole, or one hundred and twenty-nine degrees, as he put it;
while Marinus, the Tyrian, of the opposing school, and the most eminent geographer before
Ptolemy, held that the extent of the then known world spanned as much as two hundred
and twenty-five degrees, or about one hundred degrees too much.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Columbus’ calculations
were all on the side of this insufficient size.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> He wrote to Queen Isabella in 1503 that “the
earth is smaller than people suppose.” He thought but one seventh of it was water. In
sailing a direct western course his expectation was to reach Cipango after having gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
about three thousand miles. This would actually have brought him within a hundred miles
or so of Cape Henlopen, or the neighboring coast; while if no land had intervened he
would have gone nine thousand eight hundred miles to reach Japan, the modern Cipango.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Thus Columbus’ earth was something like two thirds of the actual magnitude.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It can
readily be understood how the lesser distance was helpful in inducing a crew to accompany
Columbus, and in strengthening his own determination.</p>

<p>Whatever the size of the earth, there was far less palpable reason to determine it than
to settle the question of its sphericity. The phenomena which convince the ordinary
mind to-day, weighed with Columbus as they had weighed in earlier ages. These were the
hulling down of ships at sea, and the curved shadow of the earth on the moon in an eclipse.
The law of gravity was not yet proclaimed, indeed; but it had been observed that the men
on two ships, however far apart, stood perpendicular to their decks at rest.</p>

<p>Columbus was also certainly aware of some of the views and allusions to be found in
the ancient writers, indicating a belief in lands lying beyond the Pillars of Hercules.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He
enumerates some of them in the letter which he wrote about his third voyage, and which is
printed in Navarrete. The Colombina Library contains two interesting memorials of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
connection with this belief. One is a treatise in his own hand, giving his correspondence
with Father Gorricio, who gathered the ancient views and prophecies;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and the other is a
copy of Gaietanus’ edition of Seneca’s tragedies, published indeed after Columbus’ death,
in which the passage of the <i>Medea</i>, known to have been much in Columbus’ mind, is scored
with the marginal comment of Ferdinand, his son, “Hæc prophetia expleta ē per patrē meus
cristoforū colō almirātē anno 1492.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Columbus, further, could not have been unaware of
the opposing theories of Ptolemy and Pomponius Mela as to the course in which the further
extension of the known world should be pursued. Ptolemy held to the east and west
theory, and Mela to the northern and southern view.</p>

<p>The Angelo Latin translation of Ptolemy’s Greek <i>Geographia</i> had served to disseminate
the Alexandrian geographer’s views through almost the whole of the fifteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for that version had been first made in 1409. In 1475 it had been printed, and it had
helped strengthen the arguments of those who favored a belief in the position of India as
lying over against Spain. Several other editions were yet to be printed in the new typographical
centres of Europe, all exerting more or less influence in support of the new views
advocated by Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Five of these editions of Ptolemy appeared during the interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from 1475 to 1492. Of Pomponius Mela, advocating the views of which the Portuguese
were at this time proving the truth, the earliest printed edition had appeared in 1471.
Mela’s treatise, <i>De situ orbis</i>, had been produced in the first century, while Ptolemy had
made his views known in the second; and the age of Vasco da Gama, Columbus, and
Magellan were to prove the complemental relations of their respective theories.</p>

<p>It has been said that Macrobius, a Roman of the fifth century, in a commentary on the
<i>Dream of Scipio</i>, had maintained a division of the globe into four continents, of which
two were then unknown. In the twelfth century this idea had been revived by Guillaume
de Conches (who died about 1150) in his <i>Philosophia Minor</i>, lib. iv. cap. 3. It was again
later further promulgated in the writings of Bede and Honoré d’Autun, and in the <i>Microcosmos</i>
of Geoffroy de Saint-Victor,&mdash;a manuscript of the thirteenth century still preserved.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
It is not known that this theory was familiar to Columbus. The chief directors
of his thoughts among anterior writers appear to have been, directly or indirectly, Albertus
Magnus, Roger Bacon, and Vincenzius of Beauvais;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and first among them, for
importance, we must place the <i>Opus Majus</i> Of Roger Bacon, completed in 1267. It was
from Bacon that Petrus de Aliaco, Or Pierre d’Ailly (b. 1340; d. 1416 or 1425), in his
<i>Ymago mundi</i>, borrowed the passage which, in this French imitator’s language, so
impressed Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>An important element in the problem was the statements of Marco Polo regarding a
large island, which he called Cipango, and which he represented as lying in the ocean off
the eastern coast of Asia. This carried the eastern verge of the Asiatic world farther than
the ancients had known; and, on the spherical theory, brought land nearer westward from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Europe than could earlier have been supposed. It is a question, however, if Columbus
had any knowledge of the Latin or Italian manuscripts of Marco Polo,&mdash;the only form in
which anybody could have studied his narrative before the printing of it at Nuremberg
in 1477, in German, a language which Columbus is not likely to have known. Humboldt
has pointed out that neither Columbus
nor his son Ferdinand mentions
Marco Polo; still we know that he
had read his book. Columbus further
knew, it would seem, what
Æneas Sylvius had written on Asia.
Toscanelli had also imparted to him
what he knew. A second German
edition of Marco Polo appeared at
Augsburg in 1481. In 1485, with the
<i>Itinerarius</i> of Mandeville,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> published
at Zwolle, the account&mdash;“De regionibus
orientalibus”&mdash;of Marco Polo
first appeared in Latin, translated
from the original French, in which it
had been dictated. It was probably
in this form that Columbus first saw
it.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> There was a separate Latin edition
in 1490.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The most definite confirmation
and encouragement which Columbus
received in his views would seem to
have come from Toscanelli, in 1474.
This eminent Italian astronomer, who
was now about seventy-eight years
old, and was to die, in 1482, before
Columbus and Da Gama had consummated
their discoveries, had reached a conclusion in his own mind that only about
fifty-two degrees of longitude separated Europe westerly from Asia, making the earth
much smaller even than Columbus’ inadequate views had fashioned it; for Columbus had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
satisfied himself that one hundred and twenty degrees of the entire three hundred and
sixty was only as yet unknown.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> With such views of the inferiority of the earth, Toscanelli
had addressed a letter
to Martinez, a prebendary of
Lisbon, accompanied by a
map professedly based on
information derived from the
book of Marco Polo.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> When
Toscanelli received a letter
of inquiry from Columbus,
he replied by sending a copy
of this letter and the map.
As the testimony to a western
passage from a man of
Toscanelli’s eminence, it was
of marked importance in the
conversion of others to similar
views.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>It has always been a
question how far the practical
evidence of chance
phenomena, and the absolute
knowledge, derived from
other explorers, bearing upon the views advocated by Columbus, may have instigated or
confirmed him in his belief. There is just enough plausibility in some of the stories which
are cited to make them fall easily into the pleas of detraction to which Columbus has
been subjected.</p>

<p>A story was repeated by Oviedo in 1535 as an idle rumor, adopted by Gomara in 1552
without comment, and given considerable currency in 1609 by Garcilasso de la Vega, of
a Spanish pilot,&mdash;Sanches, as the name is sometimes given,&mdash;who had sailed from
Madeira, and had been driven west and had seen land (Hispaniola, it is inferred), and
who being shipwrecked had been harbored by Columbus in his house. Under this roof
the pilot is said to have died in 1484, leaving his host the possessor of his secret. La
Vega claimed to have received the tale from his father, who had been at the Court of
Spain in the time of Ferdinand and Isabella. Oviedo repeated it, but incredulously;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
and it was later told by Gomara, Acosta, Eden, and others. Robertson,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Irving,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and
most later writers find enough in the indecision and variety of its shapes to discard it
altogether. Peter Martyr, Bernaldez, and Herrera make no mention of it. It is singular,
however, that Ferdinand de Galardi, in dedicating his <i>Traité politique des abassadeurs</i>,
published at Cologne in 1666, to a descendant of Columbus, the Duke of Veraguas, mentions
the story as an indisputable fact;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and it has not escaped the notice of querulous
writers even of our day.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Others have thought that Columbus, in his voyage to Thule or Iceland,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> in February,
1477, could have derived knowledge of the Sagas of the westerly voyages of Eric the Red
and his countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> It seems to be true that commercial relations were maintained between
Iceland and Greenland for some years later than 1400; but if Columbus knew of
them, he probably shared the belief of the geographers of his time that Greenland was a
peninsula of Scandinavia.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The extremely probable and almost necessary pre-Columbian knowledge of the northeastern
parts of America follows from the venturesome spirit of the mariners to those
seas for fish and traffic, and from the easy transitions from coast to coast by which they
would have been lured to meet the more southerly climes. The chances from such natural
causes are quite as strong an argument in favor of the early Northmen venturings as
the somewhat questionable representations of the Sagas.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> There is the same ground for
representing, and similar lack of evidence in believing, the alleged voyage of Joāo Vas
Costa Cortereal to the Newfoundland banks in 1463-1464. Barrow finds authority for it in
Cordeyro, who gives, however, no date in his <i>Historia Insulana das Ilhas a Portugal</i>,
Lisbon, 1717; but Biddle, in his <i>Cabot</i>, fails to be satisfied with Barrow’s uncertain references,
as enforced in his <i>Chronological History of Voyages into the Arctic Regions</i>,
London, 1818.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Another of these alleged northern voyagers was a Polish navigator, John Szkolny,&mdash;a
name which we get in various Latinized or other forms, as Scolve, Skolnus, Scolvus,
Sciolvus, Kolno, etc.,&mdash;who is said to have been on the Labrador coast in 1476, while in
the service of Denmark. It is so stated by Wytfliet,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Pontanus,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and Horn.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> De Costa
cites what is known as the Rouen globe, preserved in Paris, and supposed to belong to
about 1540, as showing a legend of Skolnus reaching the northwest coast of Greenland in
1476.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Hakluyt quotes Gemma Frisius and Girava. Gomara, in 1553, and Herrera, in
1601, barely refer to it.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>There is also a claim for a Dieppe navigator, Cousin, who, bound for Africa, is said to
have been driven west, and reached South America in 1488-1489. The story is told by
Desmarquets in his <i>Mémoires chronologiques pour servir à l’histoire de Dieppe</i>, i. 92,
published at Paris, 1785. Major, giving the story an examination, fully discredits it.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>There remains the claim for Martin Behaim, the Nuremberg cosmographer and navigator,
which rests upon a passage in the Latin text of the so-called <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
which states that Cam and Behaim, having passed south of the equator, turned west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and (by implication) found land. The passage is not in the German edition of the same
year, and on reference to the manuscript of the book (still preserved in Nuremberg)
the passage is found to be an interpolation written in a different hand.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It seems
likely to have been a perversion or misinterpretation of the voyage of Diego Cam down
the African coast in 1489, in which he was accompanied by Behaim. That Behaim himself
did not put the claim forward, at least in 1492, seems to be clear from the globe,
which he made in that year, and which shows no indication of the alleged voyage. The
allegation has had, however, some advocates; but the weight of authority is decidedly
averse, and the claim can hardly be said to have significant support to-day.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>It is unquestionable that the success of the Portuguese in discovering the Atlantic
islands and in pushing down the African coast, sustained Columbus in his hope of western
discovery, if it had not instigated it.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The chance wafting of huge canes, unusual
trunks of trees, and even sculptured wood and bodies of strange men, upon the shores of
the outlying islands of the Azores and Madeira, were magnified as evidences in his mind.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
When at a later day he found a tinned iron vessel in the hands of the natives of Guadeloupe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

to the west, there were stories more than enough. Sight of strange islands had been often
reported; and the maps still existing had shown a belief in those of San Brandan<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and

They had not indeed been altogether forgotten, for Marino Sanuto in 1306 had delineated
them on a map given by Camden, though this cartographer omitted them on later charts.
Traders and pirates had also visited them since 1341, but such acquaintance had
hardly caused them to be generally known.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

was a map brought in 1428 from Venice by Dom Pedro,&mdash;which, like the 1351 map, showed
the Azores,&mdash;that induced Prince Henry in 1431 to despatch the expedition which rediscovered
those islands; and they appear on the Catalan map, which Santarem (pl. 54) describes
as “Carte de Gabriell de Valsequa, faite à Mallorcha en 1439.” It was in 1466 that the

<p>The Madeira group was first discovered by an Englishman,&mdash;Machin, or Macham,&mdash;in
the reign of Edward III. (1327-1378). The narrative, put into shape for Prince Henry
of Portugal by Francisco Alcaforado, one of his esquires, was known to Irving in a French

incongruities, it has not been always accepted, though Major says the main recital is
confirmed by a document quoted from a German collection of voyages, 1507, by Dr.
Schmeller, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Science at Munich, 1847, and which, secured
for Major by Kunstmann, is examined by him in his <i>Prince Henry</i>.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The group was

Porto Santo to Perestrello; and this captain, in 1419, observing from his island a cloud in
the horizon, found, as he sailed to it, the island now called Madeira. It will be remembered
that it was the daughter of Perestrello whom Columbus at a later day married.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

well outside of the route of Prince Henry’s vessels, which were now following down the

explorations in this direction since
1415.</p>

<p>There have been claims advanced
by Margry in his <i>Les navigations Françaises

XIV<sup>e</sup> au XVI<sup>e</sup> siècle, d’après les documents
inédits tirés de France, d’Angleterre,
d’Espagne, et d’Italie</i>, pp.
13-70, Paris, 1867, and embraced in
his first section on “Les marins de
Normandie aux côtes de Guinée avant
les Portugais,” in which he cites an
old document, said to be in London,
setting forth the voyage of a vessel
from Dieppe to the coast of Africa in
1364. Estancelin had already, in 1832,
in his <i>Navigateurs Normands en Afrique</i>,
declared there were French establishments
on the coast of Guinea
in the fourteenth century,&mdash;a view
D’Avezac says he would gladly accept
if he could. Major, however, failed to
find, by any direction which Margry
could give him, the alleged London
document, and has thrown&mdash;to say the
least&mdash;discredit on the story of that
document as presented by Margry.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The African explorations of the Portuguese are less visionary, and, as D’Avezac says,

necessity rather than a conviction from fact. It found place on the earliest maps of the
revival of geographical study in the Middle Ages. It is so represented in the map of
Marino Sanuto in 1306, and in the Lorentian portolano of 1351. Major<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> doubts if the

<p>Prince Henry had been with his father at the capture
of Ceuta, opposite Gibraltar, in 1415, when the Portuguese
got their first foothold in Africa. In 1418 he established a
school of nautical observation at Sagres,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> the southwestern
promontory of his father’s kingdom, and placed the geographer,
Jayme,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> of Majorca, in charge of it. The Prince at
once sent out his first expedition down the Barbary coast;
but his vessel, being driven out of its course, discovered the
Island of Porto Santo. Expedition after expedition reached,
in successive years, the vicinity of Cape Bojador; but an inexpressible dread of the uncertainty
beyond deferred the passage of it till 1434. Cape Blanco was reached in 1445; Cape
Verde shortly after; and the River Gambia in 1447.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Cadamosto and his Venetians pushed
still farther, and saw the Southern Cross for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Between 1460 and 1464
they went beyond Cape Mesurado. Prince Henry dying in 1463, King Alfonso, in 1469,
farmed out the African commerce, and required five hundred miles to be added yearly to
the limit of discovery southward. Not long after, Diego Cam reached the Congo coast,
Behaim accompanying him. In 1487, after seventy years of gradual progress down six
thousand miles of coast, southward from Cape Non, the Portuguese under Diaz reached
the Stormy Cape,&mdash;later to be called the Cape of Good Hope. He but just rounded it
in May, and in December he was in Portugal with the news. Bartholomew, the brother
of Columbus, had made the voyage with him.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The rounding of the Cape was hardly a
surprise; for the belief in it was firmly established long before. In 1457-1459, in the
map of Fra Mauro, which had been constructed at Venice for Alonzo V., and in which
Bianco assisted, the terminal cape had been fitly drawn.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

An inscription at the break in the African coast
says that to this point the Portuguese had pushed
their discoveries in 1489; and as it shows no indication
of the voyages of Columbus and Da
Gama, Kohl places it about 1490. It may be
considered as representing the views current before
these events, Asia following the Ptolemean
drafts. The language of the map being partly
Italian and partly Portuguese, Kohl conjectures
that it was made by an Italian living in Lisbon;
and he points out the close correspondence of
the names on the western coast of Africa to the
latest Portuguese discoveries, and that its contour
is better than anything preceding.</p>

<p>Such had been the progress of the Portuguese marine, in exemplification of the southerly
quest called for by the theory of Pomponius Mela, when Columbus made his westerly
voyage in 1492
and reached, as
he supposed,
the same coast
which the Portuguese
were
seeking to touch
by the opposite
direction.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In
this erroneous

belief Columbus
remained as

like Peter Martyr,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> accepted the belief cautiously. We shall show in another place how
slowly the error was eradicated
from the cartography of even the
latter part of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>During the interval when Columbus
was in Spain, between his
second and third voyages, Vasco
da Gama sailed from Lisbon, July 8,
1497, to complete the project which
had so long animated the endeavors
of the rival kingdom. He doubled
the Cape of Good Hope in Nov.
1497, and anchored at Calicut, May
20, 1498,&mdash;a few days before Columbus
left San Lucar on his third
voyage. In the following August,
Da Gama started on his return;
and after a year’s voyage he reached
Lisbon in August, 1498.</p>

<p>Da Gama at Calicut and Columbus at Cuba gave the line of demarcation of Alexander

the limitation of their search. They desired a little more sea-room on the Atlantic side,
and were not displeased to think that a meridian considerably farther west might give
them a share of the new Indies south and north of the Spanish discoveries; so they entered
their protest against the partition of the Bull, and the two Powers held a convention at
Tordesillas, which resulted, in June, 1494, in the line being moved two hundred and seventy

<p><a name="n46" id="n46">A.</a> <span class="smcap">First Voyage.</span>&mdash;As regards the first
voyage of Columbus there has come down to us
a number of accounts, resolvable into two distinct
narratives, as originally proceeding from the
hand of Columbus himself,&mdash;his Journal, which
is in part descriptive and in part log, according to
the modern understanding of this last term; and
his Letters announcing the success and results of
his search. The fortunes and bibliographical
history of both these sources need to be told:</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Journal.</span>&mdash;Columbus himself refers to this
in his letter to Pope Alexander VI. (1503) as
being kept in the style of Cæsar’s <i>Commentaries</i>;
and Irving speaks of it as being penned
“from day to day with guileless simplicity.” In
its original form it has not been found; but we
know that Las Casas used it in his <i>Historia</i>, and
that Ferdinand Columbus must have had it before
him while writing what passes for his Life of
his father. An abridgment of the Journal in the
hand of Las Casas, was discovered by Navarrete,
who printed it in the first volume of his <i>Coleccion</i>
in 1825; it is given in a French version in the
Paris edition of the same (vol. ii.), and in Italian
in Torre’s <i>Scritti di Colombo</i>, 1864. Las Casas
says of his abstract, that he follows the very
words of the Admiral for a while after recording
the landfall; and these parts are translated by
Mr. Thomas, of the State Department at Washington,
in G. A. Fox’s paper on “The Landfall”
in the <i>Report of the Coast Survey</i> for 1880. The
whole of the Las Casas text, however, was translated
into English, at the instigation of George
Ticknor, by Samuel Kettell, and published in
Boston as <i>A Personal Narrative of the First Voyage</i>
in 1827;<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and it has been given in part, in
English, in Becher’s <i>Landfall of Columbus</i>. The
original is thought to have served Herrera in
his <i>Historia General</i>.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Letters.</span>&mdash;We know that on the 12th of
February, 1493, about a week before reaching
the Azores on his return voyage, and while his
ship was laboring in a gale, Columbus prepared
an account of his discovery, and incasing the
parchment in wax, put it in a barrel, which he
threw overboard. That is the last heard of it.
He prepared another account, perhaps duplicate,
and protecting it in a similar way, placed it on
his poop, to be washed off in case his vessel
foundered. We know nothing further of this
account, unless it be the same, substantially, with
the letters which he wrote just before making
a harbor at the Azores. One of these letters,
at least, is dated off the Canaries; and it is possible
that it was written earlier on the voyage,
and post-dated, in expectation of his making the
Canaries; and when he found himself by stress
of weather at the Azores, he neglected to change
the place. The original of neither of these letters
is known.</p>

<p>One of them was dated Feb. 15, 1493, with
a postscript dated March 4 (or 14, copies vary,
and the original is of course not to be reached;
4 would seem to be correct), and is written in
Spanish, and addressed to the “Escribano de
Racion,” Luis de Santangel, who, as Treasurer
of Aragon, had advanced money for the voyage.
Columbus calls this a second letter; by which he
may mean that the one cast overboard was the
first, or that another, addressed to Sanchez (later
to be mentioned), preceded it. There was at
Simancas, in 1818, an early manuscript copy of
this letter, which Navarrete printed in his <i>Coleccion</i>,
and Kettell translated into English in his
book (p. 253) already referred to.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>In 1852 the Baron Pietro Custodi left his
collection of books to the Biblioteca Ambrosiana
at Milan; and among them was found a
printed edition of this Santangel letter, never
before known, and still remaining unique. It is
of small quarto, four leaves, in semi-gothic type,
bearing the date of 1493,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and was, as Harrisse
and Lenox think, printed in Spain,&mdash;Major suggests
Barcelona, but Gayangos thinks Lisbon.
It was first reprinted at Milan in 1863, with a
fac-simile, and edited by Cesare Correnti, in a
volume, containing other letters of Columbus,
entitled, <i>Lettere autografe edite ed inedite di
Cristoforo Colombo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> From this reprint Harrisse
copied it, and gave an English translation
in his <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 89, drawing attention
to the error of Correnti in making it appear
on his titlepage that the letter was addressed to
“Saxis,”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and testifying that, by collation, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
had found but slight variation from the Navarrete
text. Mr. R. H. Major also prints the
Ambrosian text in his <i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>,
with an English version appended, and judges
the Cosco version could not have been made
from it. Other English translations may be
found in Becher’s <i>Landfall of Columbus</i>, p. 291,
and in French’s <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana
and Florida</i>, 2d series, ii. 145.</p>

<p>In 1866 a fac-simile edition (150 copies) of
the Ambrosian copy was issued at Milan, edited
by Gerolamo d’Adda, under the title of <i>Lettera
in lingua Spagnuola diretta da Cristoforo Colombo
a Luis de Santangel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Mr. James Lenox, of New
York, had already described it, with a fac-simile
of the beginning and end, in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>
(vol. viii. p. 289, September, 1864, April,
1865); and this paper was issued separately
(100 copies) as a supplement to the Lenox edition
of Scyllacius. Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> indicates that
there was once a version of this Santangel letter
in the Catalan tongue, preserved in the Colombina
Library at Seville.</p>

<p>A few years ago Bergenroth found at Simancas
a letter of Columbus, dated at the Canaries,
Feb. 15, 1493, with a postscript at Lisbon,
March 14, addressed to a friend, giving still another
early text, but adding nothing material to
our previous knowledge. A full abstract is given
in the <i>Calendar of State Papers relating to England
and Spain</i>, p. 43.</p>

<p>A third Spanish text of a manuscript of the
sixteenth century, said to have been found in
the Colegio Mayor de Cuenca, was made known
by Varnhagen, the Minister of Brazil to Portugal,
who printed it at Valencia in 1858 as
<i>Primera epistola del Almirante Don Christóbal
Colon</i>, including an account “de una nueva copia
de original manuscrito.” The editor assumed
the name of Volafan, and printed one hundred
copies, of which sixty were destroyed in Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
This letter is addressed to Gabriel Sanchez, and
dated “sobre la isla de Sa. Maria, 18 de Febrero;”
and is without the postscript of the letters of
Feb. 15. It is almost a verbatim repetition of
the Simancas text. A reprint of the Cosco text
makes a part of the volume; and it is the opinion
of Varnhagen and Harrisse that the Volafan
text is the original from which Cosco translated,
as mentioned later.</p>

<p>Perhaps still another Spanish text is preserved
and incorporated, as Muñoz believed,
by the Cura de los Palacios, Andrés Bernaldez,
in his <i>Historia de los reyes católicos</i> (chap. cxviii).
This book covers the period 1488-1513; has thirteen
chapters on Columbus, who had been the
guest of Bernaldez after his return from his
second voyage, in 1496, and by whom Columbus
is called “mercador de libros de estampa.” The
manuscript of Bernaldez’s book long remained
unprinted in the Royal Library at Madrid. Irving
used a manuscript copy which belonged to Obadiah
Rich.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Prescott’s copy of the manuscript
is in Harvard College Library.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Humboldt<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
used it in manuscript. It was at last printed at
Granada in 1856, in two volumes, under the
editing of Miguel Lafuente y Alcántara.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> It
remains, of course, possible that Bernaldez may
have incorporated a printed Spanish text, instead
of the original or any early manuscript, though
Columbus is known to have placed papers in
his hands.</p>

<p class="p1">The text longest known to modern students
is the poor Latin rendering of Cosco, already
referred to. While but one edition of the original
Spanish text appeared presumably in Spain
(and none of Vespucius and Magellan), this
Latin text, or translations of it, appeared in
various editions and forms in Italy, France,
and Germany, which Harrisse remarks<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> as indicating
the greater popular impression which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the discovery of America made beyond Spain
than within the kingdom; and the monthly delivery
of letters from Germany to Portugal and
the Atlantic islands, at this time, placed these
parts of Europe in prompter connection than
we are apt to imagine.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> News of the discovery
was, it would seem, borne to Italy by the two Genoese
ambassadors, Marchesi and Grimaldi, who
are known to have left Spain a few days after
the return of Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The Spanish text of
this letter, addressed by Columbus to Gabriel
or Raphael Sanchez, or Sanxis, as the name of
the Crown treasurer is variously given, would
seem to have fallen into the hands of one Aliander
de Cosco, who turned it into Latin, completing
his work on the 29th of April. Harrisse
points out the error of Navarrete and Varnhagen
in placing this completion on the 25th,
and supposes the version was made in Spain.
Tidings of the discovery must have reached
Rome before this version could have got there;
for the first Papal Bull concerning the event is
dated May 3. Whatever the case, the first publication,
in print, of the news was made in Rome
in this Cosco version, and four editions of it
were printed in that city in 1493. There is
much disagreement among bibliographers as to
the order of issue of the early editions. Their
peculiarities, and the preference of several bibliographers
as to such order, is indicated in
the following enumeration, the student being
referred for full titles to the authorities which
are cited:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pind2 p1"><b>I.</b> <i>Epistola Christofori Colom</i> [1493]. Small quarto,
four leaves (one blank), gothic, 33 lines to a page.
Addressed to Sanchis. Cosco is called Leander.
Ferdinand and Isabella both named in the title.
The printer is thought to be Plannck, from similarity
of type to work known to be his.</p>

<p class="p1">Major calls this the <i>editio princeps</i>, and gives elaborate
reasons for his opinion (<i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>,
p. cxvi). J. R. Bartlett, in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
vol. i. no. 5, also puts it first; so does Ternaux. Varnhagen
calls it the second edition. It is put the third in order
by Brunet (vol. ii. col. 164) and Lenox (<i>Scyllacius</i>, p. xliv),
and fourth by Harrisse (<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 121; <i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 4).</p>

<p>There are copies in the Lenox, Carter-Brown, and
Huth (<i>Catalogue</i>, i. 336) libraries; in the Grenville (<i>Bibl.
Gren.</i>, p. 158) and King’s Collections in the British Museum;
in the Royal Library at Munich; in the Collection
of the Duc d’Aumale at Twickenham; and in the Commercial
Library at Hamburg.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The copy cited by Harrisse
was sold in the Court Collection (no. 72) at Paris in
1884.</p>

<p class="pind2 p1"><b>II.</b> <i>Epistola Christofori Colom, impressit Rome,
Eucharius Argenteus</i> [Silber], <i>anno dñi
MCCCCXCIII</i>. Small quarto, three printed
leaves, gothic type, 40 lines to the page. Addressed
to Sanches. Cosco is called Leander.
Ferdinand and Isabella both named.</p>

<p class="p1">Major, who makes this the second edition, says that
its deviations from No. I. are all on the side of ignorance.
Varnhagen calls it the <i>editio princeps</i>. Bartlett (<i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, no. 6) puts it second. Lenox (<i>Scyllacius</i>,
p. xlv) calls it the fourth edition. It is no. 3 of Harrisse
(<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 3; <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 121).
Graesse errs in saying the words “Indie supra Gangem”
are omitted in the title.</p>

<p>There are copies in the Lenox, Carter-Brown, Huth
(<i>Catalogue</i>, i. 336), and Grenville (<i>Bibl. Gren.</i>, p. 158)
Libraries. It has been recently priced at 5,000 francs.
Cf. <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, 629.</p>

<p class="pind2 p1"><b>III.</b> <i>Epistola Christofori Colom.</i> Small quarto, four
leaves, 34 lines, gothic type. Addressed to
Sanxis. Cosco is called Aliander. Ferdinand
only named.</p>

<p class="p1">This is Major’s third edition. It is the <i>editio princeps</i>
of Harrisse, who presumes it to be printed by Stephanus
Plannck at Rome (<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 117; <i>Bibl. Amer.
Vet.</i>, vol. i.); and he enters upon a close examination to
establish its priority. It is Lenox’s second edition (<i>Scyllacius</i>,
p. xliii). Bartlett places it third.</p>

<p>There are copies in the Barlow (formerly the Aspinwall
copy) Library in New York; in the General Collection
and Grenville Library of the British Museum; and in
the Royal Library at Munich. In 1875 Mr. S. L. M.
Barlow printed (50 copies) a fac-simile of his copy, with a
Preface, in which he joins in considering this the first edition
with Harrisse, who (<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 101) gives
a careful reprint of it.</p>

<p class="pind2 p1"><b>IV.</b> <i>De insulis inventis</i>, etc. Small octavo, ten leaves,
26 and 27 lines, gothic type. The leaf before the
title has the Spanish arms on the recto. There
are eight woodcuts, one of which is a repetition.
Addressed to Sanxis. Cosco is called Aliender.
Ferdinand only named. The words “Indie supra
Gangem” are omitted in the title.</p>

<p class="p1">This is Major’s fourth edition. Lenox makes it the
<i>editio princeps</i> (as does Brunet), and gives fac-similes of
the woodcuts in his <i>Scyllacius</i>, p. xxxvi. Bossi supposed
the cuts to have been a part of the original manuscript, and
designed by Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Harrisse calls it the second in
order, and thinks Johannes Besicken may have been the
printer (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, 2), though it is usually ascribed
to Plannck, of Rome. It bears the arms of Granada; but
there was no press at that time in that city, so far as known,
though Brunet seems to imply it was printed there.</p>

<p>The only perfect copy known is one formerly the Libri
copy, now in the Lenox Library, which has ten leaves. The
Grenville copy (<i>Bibl. Gren.</i>, p. 158), and the one which
Bossi saw in the Brera at Milan, now lost, had only nine
leaves.</p>

<p>Hain (<i>Repertorium</i>, no. 5,491) describes a copy which
seems to lack the first and tenth leaves; and it was probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this copy (Royal Library, Munich) which was followed
by Pilinski in his Paris fac-simile (20 copies in 1858), which
does not reproduce these leaves, though it is stated by
some that the defective British Museum copy was his
guide. Bartlett seems in error in calling this fac-simile a
copy of the Libri-Lenox copy.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The Ternaux copy, now in the Carter-Brown Library,
was for some time supposed to be the only copy known;
but Harrisse says the text reprinted by Rosny in Paris, in
1865, as from a copy in the National Library at Paris, corresponds
to this. This reprint (125 copies) is entitled,

<p>The text of all these editions scarcely varies,
except in the use of contracted letters. Lenox’s
collation was reprinted, without the cuts, in the

accounts will be found in Graesse,
<i>Trésor</i>; <i>Bibliotheca Grenvilliana</i>, i. 158; Sabin,

<p>In 1494 this Cosco-Sanchez text was appended
to a drama on the capture of Granada,
which was printed at Basle, beginning <i>In laudem
Serenissimi Ferdinandi</i>, and ascribed to
Carolus Veradus. The “De insulis nuper inventis”
is found at the thirtieth leaf (<i>Bibl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

<p>By October, in the year of the first appearance
(1493) of the Cosco-Sanchez text, it had
been turned into <i>ottava rima</i> by Guiliano Dati,
a popular poet, to be sung about the streets,
as is supposed; and two editions of this verse
are now known. The earliest is in quarto,
black letter, two columns, and was printed in
Florence, and called <i>Questa e la Hystoria ...
extracte duna Epistola Christofano Colombo</i>.
It was in four leaves, of coarse type and
paper; but the second and third leaves are
lacking in the unique copy, now in the British
Museum, which was procured in 1858 from
the Costabile sale in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The other edition, dated one day later
(Oct. 26, 1493), printed also at Florence, and
called <i>La Lettera dell’isole</i>, etc., is in Roman
type, quarto, four leaves, two columns, with

<p>In 1497 a German translation, or adaptation,
from Cosco’s Latin was printed by Bartlomesz
Küsker at Strasburg, with the title <i>Eyn schön
kübsch lesen von etlichen inszlen die do in kurtzen
zyten funden synd durch dē künig von hispania,

what was Guanahani, the first land seen
by Columbus. The main, or rather the only,
source for the decision of this question is the
Journal of Columbus; and it is to be regretted
that Las Casas did not leave unabridged the
parts preceding the landfall, as he did those
immediately following, down to October 29.
Not a word outside of this Journal is helpful.
The testimony of the early maps is rather misleading

geography.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that land
was first seen two hours after midnight; and
computations made for Fox show that the moon
was near the third quarter, partly behind the
observer, and would clearly illuminate the white
sand of the shore, two leagues distant. From
Columbus’s course there were in his way, as
constituting the Bahama group,&mdash;taking the
enumeration of to-day, and remembering that
the sea may have made some changes,&mdash;36
islands, 687 cays, and 2,414 rocks. By the log,
as included in the Journal, and reducing his
distance sailed by dead reckoning&mdash;which then
depended on observation by the eye alone, and
there were also currents to misguide Columbus,
running from nine to thirty miles a day,
according to the force of the wind&mdash;to a course
west, 2° 49′ south, Fox has shown that the discoverer
had come 3,458 nautical miles. Applying
this to the several islands claimed as the
landfall, and knowing modern computed distances,
we get the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">Columbus speaks of the island as being
“small,” and again as “pretty large” (<i>bien
grande</i>). He calls it very level, with abundance
of water, and a very large lagune in the middle;
and it was in the last month of the rainy season,
when the low parts of the islands are usually
flooded.</p>

<p>Some of the features of the several islands
already named will now be mentioned, together
with a statement of the authorities in favor of
each as the landfall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">San Salvador, or Cat.</span>&mdash;This island is
forty-three miles long by about three broad, with
an area of about one hundred and sixty square
miles, rising to a height of four hundred feet, the
loftiest land in the group, and with no interior
water. It is usual in the maps of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries to identify this
island with the Guanahani of Columbus. It is
so considered by Catesby in his <i>Natural History
of Carolina</i> (1731); by Knox in his <i>Collection
of Voyages</i> (1767); by De la Roquette in the
French version of Navarrete, vol. ii. (1828);
and by Baron de Montlezun in the <i>Nouvelles
annales des voyages</i>, vols. x. and xii. (1828-1829).
Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, of the United
States Navy, worked out the problem for
Irving; and this island is fixed upon in the
latter’s <i>Life of Columbus</i>, app. xvi., editions
of 1828 and 1848. Becher claims that the modern
charts used by Irving were imperfect; and
he calls “not worthy to be called a chart” the
La Cosa map, which so much influenced Humboldt
in following Irving, in his <i>Examen critique</i>
(1837), iii. 181, 186-222.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Watling’s.</span>&mdash;This is thirteen miles long by
about six broad, containing sixty square miles,
with a height of one hundred and forty feet, and
having about one third its area of interior water.
It was first suggested by Muñoz in 1793. Captain
Becher, of the Royal Navy, elaborated the
arguments in favor of this island in the <i>Journal
of the Royal Geographical Society</i>, xxvi. 189, and
<i>Proceedings</i>, i. 94, and in his <i>Landfall of Columbus
on his First Voyage to America</i>, London, 1856.
Peschel took the same ground in his <i>Geschichte
des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i> (1858). R. H.
Major’s later opinion is in support of the same
views, as shown by him in the <i>Journal of the
Royal Geographical Society</i> (1871), xvi. 193, and
<i>Proceedings</i>, xv. 210. Cf. <i>New Quarterly Review</i>,
October, 1856.</p>

<p>Lieut. J. B. Murdock, U. S. N., in a paper on
“The Cruise of Columbus in the Bahamas,
1492,” published in the <i>Proceedings</i> (April, 1884,
p. 449) of the United States Naval Institute
vol. x, furnishes a new translation of the passages
in Columbus’ Journal bearing on the subject,
and made by Professor Montaldo of the
Naval Academy, and repeats the map of the
modern survey of the Bahamas as given by Fox.
Lieutenant Murdock follows and criticises the
various theories afresh, and traces Columbus’
track backward from Cuba, till he makes the
landfall to have been at Watling’s Island. He
points out also various indications of the Journal
which cannot be made to agree with any
supposable landfall.</p>

by one and a quarter miles, with an area of
seven square miles; its highest part seventy feet;
and one third of its surface is interior water.
Navarrete first advanced arguments in its favor
in 1825, and Kettell adopted his views in the
Boston edition of the <i>Personal Narrative of
Columbus</i>. George Gibbs argued for it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<i>New York Historical Society’s Proceedings</i> (1846),

F. A. de Varnhagen published at St. Jago de
Chile, in 1864, a treatise advocating this island
as <i>La verdadera Guanahani</i>, which was reissued
at Vienna, in 1869, as <i>Das wahre Guanahani des
Columbus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

miles long by one and a half wide, covering eight

of one hundred feet. It is now uninhabited; but
arrow-heads and other signs of aboriginal occupation
are found there. The Samana of the early
maps was the group now known as Crooked
Island. The present Samana has been recently
selected for the landfall by Gustavus V. Fox, in
the <i>United States Coast Survey Report</i>, 1880,

of the first landing-place of Columbus in

<p><a name="n56" id="n56"><b>C.</b></a> <span class="smcap">Effect of the Discovery in Europe.</span>&mdash;During
the interval between the return of
Columbus from his first voyage and his again
treading the soil of Spain on his return from
the second, 1494, we naturally look for the effect
of this astounding revelation upon the intelligence
of Europe. To the Portuguese, who had
rejected his pleas, there may have been some
chagrin. Faria y Sousa, in his <i>Europa Portuguesa</i>,
intimates that Columbus’ purpose in putting
in at the Tagus was to deepen the regret of
the Portuguese at their rejection of his views;
and other of their writers affirm his overbearing
manner and conscious pride of success. The interview
which he had with John II. is described
in the <i>Lyuro das obras de Garcia de Resende</i>.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Of his reception by the Spanish monarchs at
Barcelona,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> we perhaps, in the stories of the
historians, discern more embellishments than
Oviedo, who was present, would have thought
the ceremony called for. George Sumner (in
1844) naturally thought so signal an event would
find some record in the “Anals consulars” of
that city, which were formed to make note of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the commonest daily events; but he could find
in them no indication of the advent of the discoverer
of new lands.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> It is of far more importance
for us that provision was soon made for
future records in the establishment of what became
finally the “Casa de la Contratacion de
las Indias,” at this time put in charge of Juan
de Fonseca, who controlled its affairs throughout
the reign of Ferdinand.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> We have seen how
apparently an eager public curiosity prompted
more frequent impressions of Columbus’ letter
in other lands than in Spain itself; but there
was a bustling reporter at the Spanish Court
fond of letter-writing, having correspondents in
distant parts, and to him we owe it, probably,
that the news spread to some notable people.
This was Peter Martyr d’Anghiera. He dated
at Barcelona, on the ides of May, a letter mentioning
the event, which he sent to Joseph Borromeo;
and he repeated the story in later epistles, written
in September, to Ascanio Sforza, Tendilla, and
Talavera.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> There is every reason to suppose
that Martyr derived his information directly
from Columbus himself. He was now probably
about thirty-seven years old, and he had some
years before acquired such a reputation for learning
and eloquence that he had been invited from
Italy (he was a native of the Duchy of Milan)
to the Spanish Court. His letters, as they have
come down to us, begin about five years before
this,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and it is said that just at this time (1493)
he began the composition of his Decades. Las
Casas has borne testimony to the value of the
Decades for a knowledge of Columbus, calling
them the most worthy of credit of all the early
writings, since Martyr got, as he says, his accounts
directly from the Admiral, with whom
he often talked. Similar testimony is given to
their credibleness by Carbajal, Gomez, Vergara,
and other contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Beginning with
Muñoz, there has been a tendency of late years
to discredit Martyr, arising from the confusion
and even negligence sometimes discernible
in what he says. Navarrete was inclined
to this derogatory estimate. Hallam<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> goes so
far as to think him open to grave suspicion
of negligent and palpable imposture, antedating
his letters to appear prophetic. On the
other hand, Prescott<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> contends for his veracity,
and trusts his intimate familiarity with the
scenes he describes. Helps interprets the disorder
of his writings as a merit, because it is
a reflection of his unconnected thoughts and
feelings on the very day on which he recorded
any transactions.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>What is thought to be the earliest mention
in print of the new discoveries occurs in a
book published at Seville in 1493.&mdash;<i>Los tratados
del Doctor Alonso Ortiz</i>. The reference
is brief, and is on the reverse of the 43d folio.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Not far from the same time the Bishop of
Carthagena, Bernardin de Carvajal, then the
Spanish ambassador to the Pope, delivered an
oration in Rome, June 19, 1493, in which he
made reference to the late discovery of unknown
lands towards the Indies.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> These references
are all scant; and, so far as we know
from the records preserved to us, the great
event of the age made as yet no impression on
the public mind demanding any considerable
recognition.</p>

<p class="p1"><a name="n57" id="n57"><b>D.</b></a> <span class="smcap">Second Voyage</span> (<i>Sept.</i> 25, 1493, <i>to June</i>
11, 1496).&mdash;First among the authorities is the
narrative of Dr. Chanca, the physician of the
Expedition. The oldest record of it is a manuscript
of the middle of the sixteenth century, in
the Real Academia de la Historia at Madrid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
From this Navarrete printed it for the first time,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
under the title of “Segundo Viage de Cristobal
Colon,” in his <i>Coleccion</i>, i. 198.</p>

<p>Not so directly cognizant of events, but getting
his information at second hand from Guglielmo
Coma,&mdash;a noble personage in Spain,&mdash;was
Nicolas Scyllacius, of Pavia, who translated
Coma’s letters into Latin, and published his narrative,
<i>De insulis meridiani atque indici maris
nuper inventis</i>, dedicating it to Ludovico Sforza,
at Pavia (Brunet thinks Pisa), in 1594 or 1595.
Of this little quarto there are three copies known.
One is in the Lenox Library; and from this copy
Mr. Lenox, in 1859, reprinted it sumptuously
(one hundred and two copies<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>), with a translation
by the Rev. John Mulligan. In Mr. Lenox’s
Introduction it is said that his copy had originally
belonged to M. Olivieri, of Parma, and then
to the Marquis Rocca Saporiti, before it came
into Mr. Lenox’s hands, and that the only other
copy known was an inferior one in the library of
the Marquis Trivulzio at Milan. This last copy
is probably one of the two copies which Harrisse
reports as being in the palace library at Madrid
and in the Thottiana (Royal Library) at Copenhagen,
respectively.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Scyllacius adds a few details,
current at that time, which were not in
Coma’s letters, and seems to have interpreted
the account of his correspondent as implying
that Columbus had reached the Indies by the
Portuguese route round the Cape of Good
Hope. Ronchini has conjectured that this blunder
may have caused the cancelling of a large
part of the edition, which renders the little book
so scarce; but Lenox neatly replies that “almost
all the contemporaneous accounts are equally
rare.”</p>

<p>Another second-hand account&mdash;derived, however,
most probably from the Admiral himself&mdash;is
that given by Peter Martyr in his first Decade,
published in 1511, and more at length in 1516.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Accompanying Columbus on this voyage was
Bernardus Buell, or Boil, a monk of St. Benoit,
in Austria, who was sent by Pope Alexander VI
as vicar-general of the new lands, to take charge
of the measures for educating and converting the
Indians.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> It will be remembered he afterward
became a caballer against the Admiral. What he
did there, and a little of what Columbus did, one
Franciscus Honorius Philoponus sought to tell
in a very curious book, <i>Nova typis transacta
navigatio novi orbis Indiæ occidentalis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> which
was not printed till 1621. It is dedicated to
Casparus Plautius, and it is suspected that he
is really the author of the book, while he assumed
another name, more easily to laud himself.
Harrisse describes the book as having “few
details of an early date, mixed with much second-hand
information of a perfectly worthless
character.”</p>

<p>So far as we know, the only contemporary
references in a printed book to the new discoveries
during the progress of the second voyage,
or in the interval previous to the undertaking of
the third voyage, in the spring of 1498, are these:
The <i>Das Narrenschiff</i> (Ship of Fools) of Sebastian
Brant, a satire on the follies of society,
published at Basle in 1494,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and reprinted in
Latin in 1497, 1498, and in French in 1497, 1498,
and 1499,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> has a brief mention of the land previously
unknown, until Ferdinand discovered innumerable
people in the great Spanish ocean.
Zacharias Lilio, in his <i>De origine et laudibus
scientiarum</i>, Florence, 1496,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> has two allusions.
In 1497 Fedia Inghirami, keeper of the Vatican
Archives, delivered a funeral oration on Prince
John, son of Ferdinand and Isabella, and made
a reference to the New World. The little book
was probably printed in Rome. There is also a
reference in the <i>Cosmographia</i> of Antonius Nebrissensis,
printed in 1498.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

Columbus&mdash;if we accept as his the
Italian publication of 1571&mdash;tells us that the
fatiguing career of his father, and his infirmities,
prevented the Admiral from writing his
own life. For ten years after his death there
were various references to the new discoveries,
but not a single attempt to commemorate, by
even a brief sketch, the life of the discoverer.
Such were the mentions in the <i>Commentariorum
urbanorum libri</i> of Maffei,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> published in 1506,

in 1507. In the same year the narrative in the
<i>Paesi novamente retrovati</i> (1507) established an
account which was repeated in later editions,
and was followed in the <i>Novus orbis</i> of 1532.
The next year (1508) we find a reference in the
<i>Oratio</i><a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> of Fernando Tellez at Rome; in the

<p>In 1511 Peter Martyr, in his first
Decade, and Sylvanus, in his annotations of
Ptolemy, drew attention to the New World;
as did also Johannes Sobrarius in his <i>Panegyricum
carmen de gestis heroicis divi Ferdinandi</i>
<i>Catholici</i>.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The Stobnicza (Cracow) Appendix
to Ptolemy presented a new map of the Indies
in 1512; and the <i>Chronicon</i> of Eusebius, of the
same date, recorded the appearance of some of
the wild men of the West in Rouen, brought
over by a Dieppe vessel. Some copies, at least,
of Antonio de Lebrija’s edition of <i>Prudentii
opera</i>, printed at Lucca, 1512, afford another instance
of an early mention of the New World.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Again, in 1513, a new edition of Ptolemy gave
the world what is thought to have been a map
by Columbus himself; and in the same year
there was a <i>Supplementum supplementi</i> of
Jacobo Philippo, of Bergomas.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In 1514 the
<i>De natura locorum</i> (Vienna), of Albertus Magnus,
points again to Vespucius instead of Columbus;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
but Cataneo, in a poem on Genoa,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
does not forget her son, Columbus.</p>

<p>These, as books have preserved them for
us, are about all the contemporary references
to the life of the great discoverer for the first ten
years after his death.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In 1516, where we might
least expect it, we find the earliest small gathering
of the facts of his life. In the year of
Columbus’ death, Agostino Giustiniani had
begun the compilation of a polyglot psalter,
which was in this year (1516) ready for publication,
and, with a dedication to Leo X., appeared
in Genoa. The editor annotated the
text, and, in a marginal note to verse four of the
nineteenth Psalm, we find the earliest sketch of
Columbus’ life. Stevens<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> says of the note:
“There are in it several points which we do
not find elsewhere recorded, especially respecting
the second voyage, and the survey of the
south side of Cuba, as far as Evangelista, in
May, 1494. Almost all other accounts of the
second voyage, except that of Bernaldez, end
before this Cuba excursion began.”</p>

<p>Giustiniani, who was born in 1470, died in
1536, and his <i>Annali di Genoa</i><a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> was shortly
afterward published (1537), in which, on folio
ccxlix, he gave another account of Columbus,
which, being published by his executors with
his revision, repeated some errors or opinions
of the earlier Psalter account. These were not
pleasing to Ferdinand Columbus,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> the son of
the Admiral,&mdash;particularly the statement that
Columbus was born of low parentage,&mdash;“vilibus
ortus parentibus.” Stevens points out how
Ferdinand accuses Giustiniani of telling fourteen
lies about the discoverer; “but on hunting
them out, they all appear to be of trifling
consequence, amounting to little more than that
Columbus sprang from humble parents, and
that he and his father were poor, earning a livelihood
by honest toil.”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>To correct what, either from pride or from
other reasons, he considered the falsities of the
Psalter, Ferdinand was now prompted to compose
a Life of his father,&mdash;or at least such was,
until recently, the universal opinion of his authorship
of the book. As to Ferdinand’s own
relations to that father there is some doubt,
or pretence of doubt, particularly on the part
of those who have found the general belief
in, and pretty conclusive evidence concerning,
the illegitimacy of Ferdinand an obstacle in
establishing the highly moral character which
a saint, like Columbus, should have.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferdinand Columbus, or Fernando Colon,
was born three or four years before his father
sailed on his first voyage.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> His father’s favor
at Court opened the way, and in attendance
upon Prince Juan and Queen Isabella he gained
a good education. When Columbus went on
his fourth voyage, in 1502, the boy, then thirteen
years of age, accompanied his father. It is said
that he made two other voyages to the New
World; but Harrisse could only find proof of
one. His later years were passed as a courtier,
in attendance upon Charles V. on his travels,
and in literary pursuits, by which he acquired a
name for learning. He had the papers of his
father,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and he is best known by the Life of
Columbus which passes under his name. If it
was written in Spanish, it is not known in its
original form, and has not been traced since
Luis Colon, the Duque de Veraguas, son of
Diego, took the manuscript to Genoa about
1568. There is some uncertainty about its later
history; but it appeared in 1571 at Venice in an
Italian version made by Alfonzo de Ulloa, and
was entitled <i>Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo;
nelle quali s’ ha particolare &amp; vera relatione della
vita, &amp; de’ fatti dell’Ammiraglio D. Christoforo
Colombo, suo padre</i>. It is thought that this translation
was made from an inaccurate copy of the
manuscript, and moreover badly made. It begins
the story of the Admiral’s life with his
fifty-sixth year, or thereabout; and it has been
surmised that an account of his earlier years&mdash;if,
indeed, the original draft contained it&mdash;was
omitted, so as not to obscure, by poverty
and humble station, the beginnings of a luminous
career.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Ferdinand died at Seville, July
12, 1539,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and bequeathed, conditionally, his
library to the Cathedral. The collection then
contained about twenty thousand volumes, in
print and manuscript; and it is still preserved
there, though, according to Harrisse, much neglected
since 1709, and reduced to about four
thousand volumes. It is known as the Biblioteca
Colombina.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Spotorno says that this
Luis Colon, a person of debauched character,
brought this manuscript in the Spanish language
to Genoa, and left it in the hands of
Baliano de Fornari, from whom it passed to
another patrician, Giovanni Baptista Marini,
who procured Ulloa to make the Italian version
in which it was first published.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat of a controversial interest has
been created of late years by the critiques of
Henry Harrisse on Ferdinand Columbus and
his Life of his father, questioning the usually
accepted statements in Spotorno’s introduction
of the <i>Codice</i> of 1823. Harrisse undertakes to
show that the manuscript was never in Don
Luis’ hands, and that Ferdinand could not
have written it. He counts it as strange that
if such a manuscript existed in Spain not a
single writer in print previous to 1571 refers to
it. “About ten years ago,” says Henry Stevens,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
“a society of Andalusian bibliographers was
formed at Seville. Their first publication was
a fierce Hispano-French attack on the authenticity
of the Life of Columbus by his second son,
Ferdinand, written by Henri Harrisse in French,
and translated by one of the Seville bibliófilos,
and adopted and published by the Society. The
book [by Columbus’ son] is boldly pronounced
a forgery and a fraud on Ferdinand Columbus.
Some fifteen reasons are given in proof of these
charges, all of which, after abundant research
and study, are pronounced frivolous, false, and
groundless.” Such is Mr. Stevens’s view, colored
or not by the antipathy which on more than one
occasion has been shown to be reciprocal in the
references of Stevens and Harrisse, one to the
other, in sundry publications.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The views of
Harrisse were also expressed in the supplemental
volume of his <i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>,
published as <i>Additions</i> in 1872. In this
he says, regarding the Life of Columbus: “It
was not originally written by the son of the bold
navigator; and many of the circumstances it relates
have to be challenged, and weighed with
the utmost care and impartiality.”</p>

<p>The authenticity of the book was ably sustained
by D’Avezac before the French Academy
in a paper which was printed in 1873 as
<i>Le livre de Ferdinand Colomb: Revue critique
des allégations proposées contre son authenticité</i>.
Harrisse replied in 1875 in a pamphlet of fifty-eight
pages, entitled <i>L’histoire de C. Colomb attribuée
à son fils Fernand: Examen critique du
mémoire lu par M. d’Avezac à l’Académie</i>, 8, 13,
<i>22 Août, 1873</i>. There were other disputants on
the question.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>The catalogue of the Colombina Library as
made by Ferdinand shows that it contained originally
a manuscript Life of the Admiral written
about 1525 by Ferdinand Perez de Oliva, who
presumably had the aid of Ferdinand Columbus
himself; but no trace of this Life now exists,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> unless,
as Harrisse ventures to conjecture, it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have been in some sort the basis of what now
passes for the work of Ferdinand.</p>

<p class="p2">For a long time after the <i>Historie</i> of 1571
there was no considerable account of Columbus
printed. Editions of Ptolemy, Peter Martyr,
Oviedo, Grynæus, and other general books,
made reference to his discoveries; but the next
earliest distinct sketch appears to be that in
the <i>Elogia virorum illustrium</i> of Jovius, printed
in 1551 at Florence, and the Italian version made
by Domenichi, printed in 1554.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Ramusio’s
third volume, in 1556, gave the story greater
currency than before; but such a book as
Cunningham’s <i>Cosmographical Glasse</i>, in its
chapter on America, utterly ignores Columbus
in 1559.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> We get what may probably be called
the hearsay reports of Columbus’ exploits in
the <i>Mondo nuovo</i> of Benzoni, first printed at
Venice in 1565. There was a brief memorial in
the <i>Clarorum Ligurum elogia</i> of Ubertus Folieta,
published at Rome in 1573.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In 1581 his voyages
were commemorated in an historical poem, <i>Laurentii
Gambaræ Brixiani de navigatione Christophori
Columbi</i>, published at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Boissard,
of the De Bry coterie at Frankfort in 1597,
included Columbus in his <i>Icones virorum illustrium</i>;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
and Buonfiglio Costanzo, in 1604, commemorated
him in the <i>Historia Siciliana</i>, published
at Venice.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the story of Columbus’ voyages
was told at last with all the authority of official
sanction in the <i>Historia general</i> of Herrera.
This historian, or rather annalist, was born in
1549, and died in 1625;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and the appointment of
historiographer given him by Philip II. was continued
by the third and fourth monarchs of that
name. There has been little disagreement as to
his helpfulness to his successors. All critics
place him easily first among the earlier writers;
and Muñoz, Robertson, Irving, Prescott, Ticknor,
and many others have united in praise of
his research, candor, and justness, while they
found his literary skill compromised in a measure
by his chronological method. Irving found
that Herrera depended so much on Las Casas
that it was best in many cases to go to that earlier
writer in preference;<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and Muñoz thinks
only Herrera’s judicial quality preserved for him
a distinct character throughout the agglutinizing
process by which he constructed his book. His
latest critic, Hubert H. Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> calls his style
“bald and accurately prolix, his method slavishly
chronological,” with evidence everywhere in his
book of “inexperience and incompetent assistance,”
resulting in “notes badly extracted, discrepancies,
and inconsistencies.” The bibliography
of Herrera is well done in Sabin.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Herrera had already published (1591) a monograph
on the history of Portugal and the conquest
(1582-1583) of the Azores, when he produced at
Madrid his great work, <i>Historia general de los
hechos de los Castellanos</i>, in eight decades, four of
which, in two volumes, were published in 1601,
and the others in 1615.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> It has fourteen maps;
and there should be bound with it, though often
found separate, a ninth part, called <i>Description
de las Indias occidentales</i>.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Of the composite
work, embracing the nine parts, the best edition
is usually held to be one edited by Gonzales
Barcia, and supplied by him with an index,
which was printed in Madrid during 1727, 1728,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
1729, and 1730, so that copies are found with all
those dates, though it is commonly cited as of
1730.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The principal chronicles of Spanish affairs in
the seventeenth century contributed more or less
to Columbus’ fame;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and he is commemorated
in the Dutch compilation of Van den Bos, <i>Leven
en Daden der Zeehelden</i>, published at Amsterdam
in 1676, and in a German translation in 1681.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>There were a hundred years yet to pass before
Robertson’s <i>History of America</i> gave Columbus
a prominence in the work of a historian of
established fame; but this Scotch historian was
forced to write without any knowledge of Columbus’
own narratives.</p>

<p>In 1781 the earliest of the special Italian
commemorations appeared at Parma, in J. Durazzo’s
<i>Elogi storici</i> on Columbus and Doria.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
Chevalier de Langeac in 1782 added to his
poem, <i>Colomb dans les fers à Ferdinand et Isabelle</i>,
a memoir of Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The earliest commemoration in the United
States was in 1792, on the three hundredth anniversary
of the discovery, celebrated by the
Massachusetts Historical Society, when Dr. Jeremy
Belknap delivered an historical discourse,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
included later with large additions in his well-known
<i>American Biography</i>. The unfinished history
of Muñoz harbingered, in 1793, the revival
in Europe of the study of his career. Finally, the
series of modern Lives of Columbus began in
1818 with the publication at Milan of Luigi
Bossi’s <i>Vita di Cristoforo Colombo, scritta e corredata
di nuove osservazioni</i>.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> In 1823 the introduction
by Spotorno to the <i>Codice</i>, and in 1825 the
<i>Coleccion</i> of Navarrete, brought much new material
to light; and the first to make use of it
were Irving, in his <i>Life of Columbus</i>, 1828,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and
Humboldt, in
his <i>Examen critique
de l’histoire
de la géographie du nouveau continent</i>, published
originally, in 1834, in a single volume; and again
in five volumes, between 1836 and 1839.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> “No
one,” says Ticknor,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> “has comprehended the
character of Columbus as Humboldt has,&mdash;its
generosity, its enthusiasm, its far-reaching visions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which seemed watchful beforehand for the great
scientific discovery of the sixteenth century.”
Prescott was warned by the popularity of Irving’s
narrative not to attempt to rival him;
and his treatment of Columbus’ career was confined
to such a survey as would merely complete
the picture of the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>In 1844 there came the first intimation of
a new style of biography,&mdash;a protest against
Columbus’ story being longer told by his natural
enemies, as all who failed to recognize his
pre-eminently saintly character were considered
to be. There was a purpose in it to make the
most possible of all his pious ejaculations, and of
his intention, expressed in his letter to the Pope
in 1502, to rescue the Holy City from the infidel,
with his prospective army of ten thousand horse
and a hundred thousand foot. The chief spokesman
of this purpose has been Roselly de Lorgues.
He first shadowed forth his purpose in his <i>La
croix dans les deux mondes</i> in 1844. It was not
till 1864 that he produced the full flower of
his spirit in his <i>Christophe Colomb, Histoire de sa
vie et de ses voyages d’après des documents authentiques
tirés d’Espagne et d’Italie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> This was followed,
in 1874, by his <i>L’ambassadeur de Dieu et
le Pape Pie IX.</i> All this, however, and much
else by the abetters of the scheme of the canonization
of Columbus which was urged on the
Church, failed of its purpose; and the movement
was suspended, for a while at least, because
of an ultimate adverse determination.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Of the other later lives of Columbus it remains
to mention only the most considerable, or
those of significant tendency.</p>

<p>The late Sir Arthur Helps wrote his <i>Spanish
Conquest of America</i> with the aim of developing
the results&mdash;political, ethnological, and economic&mdash;of
the conquest, rather than the day-by-day
progress of events, and with a primary
regard to the rise of slavery. His <i>Life of Columbus</i>
is simply certain chapters of this larger work
excerpted and fitted in order.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Mr. Aaron Goodrich,
in <i>A History of the so-called Christopher Columbus</i>,
New York, 1874, makes a labored and
somewhat inconsiderate effort, characterized by
a certain peevish air, to prove Columbus the
mere borrower of others’ glories.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>In French, mention may be made of the
Baron de Bonnefoux’s <i>Vie de Christophe Colomb</i>,
Paris, 1853,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and the Marquis de Belloy’s <i>Christophe
Colomb et la découverte du Nouveau Monde</i>,
Paris, 1864.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>In German, under the impulse given by
Humboldt, some fruitful labors have been given
to Columbus and the early history of American
discovery; but it is only necessary to
mention the names of Forster,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Peschel,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and

there is no likeness whose claim to consideration

Herrera, who had the best sources of information.
From these we learn that his face was
long, neither full nor thin; his cheek-bones
rather high; his nose aquiline; his eyes light
gray; his complexion fair, and high colored.
His hair, which was of light color before thirty,
became gray after that age. In the <i>Paesi novamente

<p>These are the test with which to challenge
the very numerous so-called likenesses of Columbus;
and it must be confessed not a single one,
when you take into consideration the accessories

<p>A vignette on the map of La Cosa, dated
1500, represents Saint Christopher bearing on
his shoulders the infant Christ across a stream.
This has been considered symbolical of the
purpose of Columbus in his discoveries; and upholders
of the movement to procure his canonization,
like De Lorgues, have claimed that La
Cosa represented the features of Columbus in
the face of Saint Christopher. It has also been
claimed that Herrera must have been of the
same opinion, since the likeness given by that
historian can be imagined to be an enlargement
of the head on the map. This theory is hardly
accepted, however, by the critics.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

1881, and not, it seems, without exciting suspicion of a contrived piece of flattery for the Duke of Veraguas,

</div></div>

<p>Discarding the La Cosa vignette, the earliest
claimant now known is an engraving published
in the <i>Elogia virorum illustrium</i> (1575)<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> of
Paolo Giovio (Paulus Jovius, in the Latin form).
This woodcut is thought to have been copied
from a picture which Jovius had placed in the
gallery of notable people which he had formed
in his villa at Lake Como. That collection is
now scattered, and the Columbus picture cannot
be traced; but that there was a portrait of the
discoverer there, we know from the edition of
Vasari’s <i>Lives of the Painters</i> printed by Giunti
at Florence (1568), wherein is a list of the pictures,
which includes likenesses of Vespucius,
Cortes, and Magellan, besides that of “Colombo
Genovese.” This indicates a single picture; but
it is held by some that Jovius must
have possessed two pictures, since
this woodcut gives Columbus the
garb of a Franciscan, while the
painting in the gallery at Florence,
supposed also to follow a picture
belonging to Jovius, gives him a
mantle. A claim has been made that
the original Jovius portrait is still in
existence in what is known as the
Yanez picture, now in the National
Library in Madrid, which was purchased
of Yanez in Granada in 1763.
It had originally a close-fitting tunic
and mantle, which was later painted
over so as to show a robe and fur
collar. This external painting has
been removed; and the likeness
bears a certain resemblance to the
woodcut and to the Florence likeness.
The Yanez canvas is certainly
the oldest in Spain; and the
present Duque de Veraguas considers
it the most authentic of all
the portraits.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The annexed cut of
it is taken from an engraving in
Ruge’s <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der
Entdeckungen</i> (p. 235). It bears the
inscription shown in the cut.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The woodcut (1575) already mentioned
passes as the prototype of
another engraving by Aliprando
Capriolo, in the <i>Ritratti di cento
capitani illustri</i>, published at Rome
in 1596.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The most interesting of all pictures bearing
a supposed relation to the scattered collection at
Lake Como is in the gallery at Florence, which
is sometimes said to have been painted by
Cristofano dell’Altissimo, and before
the year 1568. A copy of it was made
for Thomas Jefferson in 1784, which was
at Monticello in 1814; and, having been
sent to Boston to be disposed of, became
the property of Israel Thorndike,
and was by him given to the Massachusetts
Historical Society, in whose gallery
it now is; and from a photograph
of it the cut (p. 74) has been engraved.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>

<p>After the woodcut of 1575, the next
oldest engraved likeness of Columbus
is the one usually called the De Bry
portrait. It shows a head with a three-cornered
cap, and possesses a Dutch
physiognomy,&mdash;its short, broad face
not corresponding with the descriptions
which we find in Oviedo and the others.
De Bry says that the original painting
was stolen from a saloon in the Council
for the Indies in Spain, and, being taken
to the Netherlands, fell into his hands.
He claims that it was painted from life
by order of Ferdinand, the King. De
Bry first used the plate in Part V. of
his <i>Grands Voyages</i>, both in the Latin
and German editions, published in 1595,
where it is marked as engraved by Jean de Bry.
It shows what seem to be two warts on the cheek,
which do not appear in later prints.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Feuillet de

<p>A similar out-of-date ruff and mustache

to Parmigiano (who was three years

by Prescott for his <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>

dead.”<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The story which Irving
has written of the successive burials
of Columbus needs to be rewritten;
and positive evidence is
wanting to show that his remains
were placed first, as is alleged, in a
vault of the Franciscans at Valladolid.
The further story, as told
by Irving, of Ferdinand’s ordering
the removal of his remains to Seville
seven years later, and the
erection of a monument, is not confirmed
by any known evidence.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
From the tenor of Diego’s will in
March, 1509, it would seem that the
body of Columbus had already been
carried to Seville, and that later,
the coffins of his son Diego and
of his brother Bartholomew were
laid in Seville beside him, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<i>cuevas</i>, or vaults of the Carthusians. Meanwhile
the Cathedral in Santo Domingo was begun,&mdash;not
to be completed till 1540; and in this island
it had been the Admiral’s wish to be buried.</p>

<p>His family were desirous of carrying out that
wish; but it seemed to require three royal
orders to make good the project, and overcome
objections or delays. These orders were dated
June 2, 1537, Aug. 22, 1539, and Nov. 5, 1540.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
It has been conjectured from the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Ferdinand Columbus’ will, in 1539, that the
remains were still in the <i>cuevas</i>; and it is supposed
that they were carried to Santo Domingo
in 1541,&mdash;though, if so, there is no record of
their resting-place from 1536,&mdash;when they are
said, in the Convent’s Records,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> to have been
delivered up for transportation. The earliest
positive mention of their being in the Cathedral
at Santo Domingo is in 1549;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and it is not till
the next century that we find a positive statement
that the remains of Diego were also removed.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
Not till 1655 does any record say that
the precise spot in the Cathedral containing the
remains was known, and not till 1676 do we
learn what that precise spot was,&mdash;“on the right
of the altar.” In 1683 we first learn of “a
leaden case in the sanctuary, at the side of the
platform of the high altar, with the remains of
his brother Don Luis on the other side, according
to the tradition of the aged in this island.”<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
The book from which this is extracted<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> was

<p>Just a century later,
in 1783, Moreau de
Saint-Méry, prefacing
his <i>Description topographique</i>
of Santo Domingo,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
sought more
explicit information,
and learned that, shortly
before his inquiry,
the floor of the chancel
had been raised so as
to conceal the top of
the vault, which was
“a case of stone” (containing
the leaden coffin),
on the “Gospel
side of the sanctuary.”
This case had been
discovered during the
repairs, and, though
“without inscription,
was known from uninterrupted
and invariable
tradition to contain
the remains of Columbus;”
and the Dean of
the Chapter, in certifying
to this effect,
speaks of the “leaden
urn as a little damaged, and containing several
human bones;” while he had also, some years
earlier, found on “the Epistle side” of the altar a
similar stone case, which, according to tradition,
contained the bones of the Admiral’s brother.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>A few years later the treaty of Basle, July
22, 1795, gave to France the half of Santo Domingo
still remaining to Spain; and at the cost
of the Duke of Veraguas, and with the concurrence
of the Chapter of the Cathedral, the
Spanish General, Gabriel de Aristazabal, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
hurriedly opened a vault on the left of the
altar, and, with due ceremony and notarial
record,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> took from it fragments of a leaden
case and some human bones, which were
unattested by any inscription found with them.
The relics were placed in a gilt leaden case,
and borne with military honors to Havana.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
It is now claimed that these remains were of
Diego, the son, and that the vault then opened
is still empty in the Cathedral, while the genuine
remains of Columbus were left undisturbed.</p>

<p>In 1877, in making some changes about
the chancel, on the right of the altar, the
workmen opened a vault, and found a leaden
case containing human bones, with an inscription
showing them to be those of Luis,
the grandson. This led to a search on the
opposite, or “Gospel, side” of the chancel,
where they found an empty vault, supposed
to be the one from which the remains were
taken to Havana. Between this and the side
wall of the building, and separated from the
empty vault by a six-inch wall, was found
another cavity, and in it a leaden case. There
seem to have been suitable precautions taken
to avoid occasion for imputations of deceit,
and with witnesses the case was examined.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
In it were found some bones and dust, a leaden
bullet,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> two iron screws, which fitted the holes
in a small silver plate found beneath the mould
in the bottom of the case.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> This casket bore
on the outside, on the front, and two ends&mdash;one

The Spanish King named Señor Antonio Lopez
Prieto, of Havana, to go to Santo Domingo,
and, with the Spanish consul, to investigate.
Prieto had already printed a tract, which went
through two editions, <i>Los restos de Colon:
exámen histórico-critico</i>, Havana, 1877.</p>

</div>

<p>In
March, 1878, he addressed his Official Report
to the Captain-general of Cuba, which was
printed in two editions during the same year,
as <i>Informe sobre los restos de Colon</i>. It was an
attack upon the authenticity of the remains at
Santo Domingo. Later in the same year, Oct.
14, 1878, Señor Manuel Colmeiro presented, in
behalf of the Royal Academy of History of
Madrid, a report to the King, which was printed
at Madrid in 1879 as <i>Los restos de Colon:
informe de la Real Academia de la Historia</i>, etc.
It reinforced the views of Prieto’s Report;
charged Roque Cocchia with abetting a fraud;
pointed to the A (America) of the outside inscription
as a name for the New World which
Spaniards at that time never used;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and
claimed that the remains discovered in 1877
were those of Christopher Columbus, the grandson
of the Admiral, and that the inscriptions
had been tampered with, or were at least much
later than the date of reinterment in the Cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
Besides Bishop Roque Cocchia, the principal
upholder of the Santo Domingo theory
has been Emiliano Tejera, who published his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<i>Los restos de Colon en Santo Domingo</i> in 1878,
and his <i>Los dos restos de Cristóbal Colon</i> in
1879, both in Santo Domingo. Henry Harrisse,
under the auspices of the “Sociedad de Bibliófilos
Andaluces,” printed his <i>Los restos de Don
Cristóval Colon</i> at Seville in 1878, and his <i>Les
sépultures de Christophe Colomb: revue critique
du premier rapport officiel publié sur ce sujet</i>,
the next year (1879) at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> From Italy we
have Luigi Tommaso Belgrano’s <i>Sulla recente
scoperta delle ossa di Colombo</i> (Genoa, 1878). One
of the best and most recent summaries of the
subject is by John G. Shea in the <i>Magazine of
American History</i>, January, 1883; also printed
separately, and translated into Spanish. Richard
Cortambert (<i>Nouvelle histoire des voyages</i>,
p. 39) considers the Santo Domingo theory overcome
by the evidence.</p>

<p class="p1"><a name="n83" id="n83"><b>J.</b></a> <span class="smcap">Date and Place of Birth of Columbus,
and Accounts of his Family.</span>&mdash;The
year and place of Columbus’ birth, and the station
into which he was born, are questions of dispute.
Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> epitomizes the authorities upon the
year of his nativity. Oscar Peschel reviews the
opposing arguments in a paper printed in <i>Ausland</i>
in 1866.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The whole subject was examined at
greater length and with great care by D’Avezac
before the Geographical Society of Paris in
1872.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> The question is one of deductions from
statements not very definite, nor wholly in accord.
The extremes of the limits in dispute are
about twenty years; but within this interval,
assertions like those of Ramusio<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> (1430) and
Charlevoix<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> (1441) may be thrown out as susceptible
of no argument.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In favor of the earliest date&mdash;which, with
variations arising from the estimates upon fractions
of years, may be placed either in 1435,
1436, or 1437&mdash;are Navarrete, Humboldt, Ferdinand
Höfer,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Émile Deschanel,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Lamartine,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
Irving, Bonnefoux, Roselly de Lorgues, l’Abbé
Cadoret, Jurien de la Gravière,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Napione,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Cancellieri,
and Cantù.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> This view is founded upon
the statement of one who had known Columbus,
Andres Bernaldez, in his <i>Reyes católicos</i>, that
Columbus was about seventy years old at his
death, in 1506.</p>

<p>The other extreme&mdash;similarly varied from
the fractions between 1455 and 1456&mdash;is taken
by Oscar Peschel,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> who deduces it from a letter
of Columbus dated July 7, 1503, in which he
says that he was twenty-eight when he entered
the service of Spain in 1484; and Peschel argues
that this is corroborated by adding the
fourteen years of his boyhood, before going to
sea, to the twenty-three years of sea-life which
Columbus says he had had previous to his
voyage of discovery, and dating back from 1492,
when he made this voyage.</p>

<p>A middle date&mdash;placed, according to fractional
calculations, variously from 1445 to 1447&mdash;is
held by Cladera,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Bossi, Muñoz, Casoni,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
Salinerio,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Robertson, Spotorno, Major, Sanguinetti,
and Canale. The argument for this
view, as presented by Major, is this: It was
in 1484, and not in 1492, that this continuous
sea-service, referred to by Columbus, ended;
accordingly, the thirty-seven years already mentioned
should be deducted from 1484, which
would point to 1447 as the year of his birth,&mdash;a
statement confirmed also, as is thought, by
the assertion which Columbus makes, in 1501,
that it was forty years since he began, at fourteen,
his sea-life. Similar reasons avail with
D’Avezac, whose calculations, however, point
rather to the year 1446.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p class="p2">A similar uncertainty has been made to appear
regarding the place of Columbus’ birth.
Outside of Genoa and dependencies, while discarding
such claims as those of England,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Corsica,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> and Milan,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> there are more defensible
presentations in behalf of Placentia (Piacenza),
where there was an ancestral estate of the Admiral,
whose rental had been enjoyed by him
and by his father;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and still more urgent demands
for recognition on the part of Cuccaro
in Montferrat, Piedmont, the lord of whose
castle was a Dominico Colombo,&mdash;pretty well
proved, however, not to have been the Dominico
who was father of the Admiral. It seems
certain that the paternal Dominico did own
land in Cuccaro, near his kinspeople, and lived
there as late as 1443.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of these claims, the Academy
of Sciences in Genoa named a commission, in
1812, to investigate them; and their report,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
favoring the traditional belief in Genoa as the
true spot of Columbus’ birth, is given in digest
in Bossi.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The claim of Genoa seems to be
generally accepted to-day, as it was in the Admiral’s
time by Peter Martyr, Las Casas, Bernaldez,
Giustiniani, Geraldini, Gallo, Senaraya,
and Foglietto.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Columbus himself twice, in his
will (1498), says he was born in Genoa; and in
the codicil (1506) he refers to his “beloved
country, the Republic of Genoa.” Ferdinand
calls his father “a Genoese.”<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Of modern
writers Spotorno, in the Introduction to the
<i>Codice diplomatico Colombo-Americano</i> (1823),
and earlier, in his <i>Della origine e della patria
di Colombo</i> (1819), has elaborated the claim,
with proofs and arguments which have been
accepted by Irving, Bossi, Sanguinetti, Roselly,
De Lorgues, and most other biographers and
writers.</p>

<p>There still remains the possibility of Genoa,
as referred to by Columbus and his contemporaries,
signifying the region dependent on it,
rather than the town itself; and with this latitude
recognized, there are fourteen towns, or
hamlets as Harrisse names them,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> which present
their claims.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Ferdinand Columbus resented Giustiniani’s
statement that the Admiral was of humble origin,
and sought to connect his father’s descent
with the Colombos of an ancient line and fame;
but his disdainful recognition of such a descent
is, after all, not conducive to a belief in Ferdinand’s
own conviction of the connection.</p>

of Columbus, as a table in Spotorno’s
<i>Della origine e della patria di Colombo</i>, 1819,
connects it with other lines, whose heirs at a
later day were aroused to claim the Admiral’s
honors; and as the usual accounts of his immediate
descendants record the transmission of his
rights. After Columbus’ death, his son Diego
demanded the restitution of the offices and
privileges<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> which had been suspended during
the Admiral’s later years.</p>

<p>He got no satisfaction but the privilege of contending at law with
the fiscal minister of the Crown, and of giving
occasion for all the latent slander about the
Admiral to make itself heard. The tribunal
was the Council of the Indies; the suit was
begun in 1508, and lasted till 1527. The documents
connected with the case are in the
Archives of the Indies. The chief defence of
the Crown was that the original convention
was against law and public policy, and that
Columbus, after all, did not discover <i>Terra
firma</i>, and for such discovery alone honors of
this kind should be the reward. Diego won the
Council’s vote; but Ferdinand, the King, hesitated
to confirm their decision. Meanwhile
Diego had married a niece of the Duke of
Alva, the King’s favorite, and got in this way
a royal grant of something like vice-royal authority
in the Indies, to which he went (1509)
with his bride, prepared for the proper state
and display. His uncles, Bartholomew and
Diego, as well as Ferdinand Columbus, accompanied
him. The King soon began to encroach
on Diego’s domain, creating new provinces out
of it.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> It does not belong to this place to trace
the vexatious factions which, through Fonseca’s
urging, or otherwise created, Diego was forced
to endure, till he returned to Spain, in 1515, to
answer his accusers. When he asked of the
King a share of the profits of the Darien coast,
his royal master endeavored to show that Diego’s
father had never been on that coast. After
Ferdinand’s death (Jan. 23, 1516), his successor,
Charles V., acknowledged the injustice
of the charges against Diego, and made some
amends by giving him a viceroy’s functions in
all places discovered by his father. He was
subjected, however, to the surveillance of a supervisor
to report on his conduct, upon going to
his government in 1520.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> In three years he was
again recalled for examination, and in 1526 he
died. Don Luis, who succeeded to his father
Diego, after some years exchanged, in 1556, his
rights of vice-royalty in the Indies for ten thousand
gold doubloons and the title of Duque de
Veraguas (with subordinate titles), and a grandeeship
of the first rank;<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> the latter, however,
was not confirmed till 1712.</p>

<p>His nephew Diego succeeded to the rights,
silencing those of the daughter of Don Luis by
marrying her. They had no issue; and on his
death, in 1578, various claimants brought suit
for the succession (as shown in the table), which
was finally given, in 1608, to the grandson of
Isabella, the granddaughter of Columbus. This
suit led to the accumulation of a large amount
of documentary evidence, which was printed.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
The vexations did not end here, the Duke of
Berwick still contesting; but a decision in 1790
confirmed the title in the present line. The
revolt of the Spanish colonies threatened to
deprive the Duke of Veraguas of his income;
but the Spanish Government made it good by
charging it upon the revenues of Cuba and
Porto Rico, the source of the present Duke’s
support.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>After the foregoing chapter had been completed,
there came to hand the first volume
of <i>Christophe Colomb, son origine, sa vie, ses
voyages, sa famille, et ses descendants, d’après des
documents inédits tirés des Archives de Gênes, de
Savone, de Séville, et de Madrid, études d’histoire
critique par Henry Harrisse</i>, Paris, 1884.</p>

<p>The book is essentially a reversal of many
long-established views regarding the career of
Columbus. The new biographer, as has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
shown, is not bound by any respect for the Life
of the Admiral which for three hundred years
has been associated with the name of Ferdinand
Columbus. The grounds of his discredit of that
book are again asserted; and he considers the
story as given in Las Casas as much more likely
to represent the prototype both of the <i>Historia
general</i> of this last writer and of the <i>Historie</i>
of 1571, than the mongrel production which he
imagines this Italian text of Ulloa to be, and
which he accounts utterly unworthy of credit by
reason of the sensational perversions and additions
with which it is alloyed by some irresponsible
editor. This revolutionary spirit makes
the critic acute, and sustains him in laborious
search; but it is one which seems sometimes to
imperil his judgment. He does not at times
hesitate to involve Las Casas himself in the
same condemnation for the use which, if we
understand him, Las Casas may be supposed,
equally with the author or editor of the <i>Historie</i>,
to have made of their common prototype. That
any received incident in Columbus’ career is only
traceable to the <i>Historie</i> is sufficient, with our
critic, to assign it to the category of fiction.</p>

<p>This new Life adds to our knowledge from
many sources; and such points as have been
omitted or slightly developed in the preceding
chapter, or are at variance with the accepted
views upon which that chapter has been based,
it may be well briefly to mention.</p>

<p>The frontispiece is a blazon of the arms of
Columbus, “du cartulaire original dressé sous
ses yeux à Seville en 1502,” following a manuscript
in the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs at Paris. The field of the quarter
with the castle is red; that of the lion is silver;
that of the anchors is blue; the main and
islands are gold, the water blue. It may be
remarked that the disposition of these islands
seems to have no relation to the knowledge then
existing of the Columbian Archipelago. Below
is a blue bend on a gold field, with red above
(see the cut, <i>ante</i>, p. 15).</p>

<p>In writing in his Introduction of the sources
of the history of Columbus, Harrisse says that
we possess sixty-four memoirs, letters, or extracts
written by Columbus, of which twenty-three
are preserved in his own autograph. Of
these sixty-four, only the <i>Libro de las profecias</i>
has not been printed entire, if we except a <i>Memorial
que presentó Cristóbal Colon á los Reyes
Catolicos sobre las cosas necesarias para abastecer
las Indias</i> which is to be printed for the first
time by Harrisse, in the appendix of his second
volume. Las Casas’ transcript of Columbus’
<i>Journal</i> is now, he tells us, in the collection of
the Duque d’Osuna at Madrid. The copy of
Dr. Chanca’s relation of the second voyage, used
by Navarrete, and now in the Academy of History
at Madrid, belonged to a collection formed
by Antonio de Aspa. The personal papers of
Columbus, confided by him to his friend Gaspar
Gorricio, were preserved for over a century in
an iron case in the custody of monks of Las
Cuevas; but they were, on the 15th of May, 1609,
surrendered to Nuño Gelves, of Portugal, who
had been adjudged the lawful successor of the
Admiral. Such as have escaped destruction
now constitute the collection of the present
Duque de Veraguas; and of them Navarrete
has printed seventy-eight documents. Of the
papers concerning Columbus at Genoa, Harrisse
finds only one anterior to his famous voyage,
and that is a paper of the Father Dominico
Colombo, dated July 21, 1489, of whom such
facts as are known are given, including references
to him in 1463 and 1468 in the records of
the Bank of St. George in Genoa. Of the two
letters of 1502 which Columbus addressed to
the Bank, only one now exists, as far as Harrisse
could learn, and that is in the Hôtel de Ville.
Particularly in regard to the family of Columbus,
he has made effective use of the notarial
and similar records of places where Columbus
and his family have lived. But use of depositions
for establishing dates and relationship
imposes great obligation of care in the identification
of the persons named; and this with a
family as numerous as the Colombos seem to
have been, and given so much to the repeating
of Christian names, is more than usually difficult.
In discussing the evidence of the place
and date of Columbus’ birth (p. 137), as well as
tracing his family line (pp. 160 and 166), the
conclusion reached by Harrisse fixes the humble
origin of the future discoverer; since he finds Columbus’
kith and kin of the station of weavers,&mdash;an
occupation determining their social standing
as well in Genoa as in other places at that time.
The table which is given on a previous page (<i>ante</i>,
p. 87) shows the lines of supposable connection,
as illustrating the long contest for the possession
of the Admiral’s honors. His father’s
father, it would seem, was a Giovanni Colombo
(pp. 167-216), and he the son of a certain Luca
Colombo. Giovanni lived in turn at Terrarossa
and Quinto. Domenico, the Admiral’s father,
married Susanna Fontanarossa, and removed
to Genoa between 1448 and 1551, living there
afterward, except for the interval 1471-1484,
when he is found at Savona. He died in
Genoa not far from 1498. We are told (p. 29)
how little the Archives of Savona yield respecting
the family. Using his new notarial evidence
mainly, the critic fixes the birth of Columbus
about 1445 (pp. 223-241); and enforces a view
expressed by him before, that Genoa as the place
of Columbus’ birth must be taken in the broader
sense of including the dependencies of the city, in
one of which he thinks Columbus was born
(p. 221) in that humble station which Gallo, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
“De navigatione Columbi,” now known to us as
Printed in Muratori (xxiii. 301), was the first to
assert. Giustiniani, in his Psalter-note, and
Senarega, in his “De rebus Genuensibus” (Muratori,
xxiv. 354) seem mainly to have followed
Gallo on this point. There is failure (p. 81) to
find confirmation of some of the details of the
family as given by Casoni in his <i>Annali della
republica di Genova</i> (1708, and again 1799). In
relation to the lines of his descendants, there
are described (pp. 49-60) nineteen different memorials,
bearing date between 1590 and 1792&mdash;and
there may be others&mdash;which grew out of
the litigations in which the descent of the Admiral’s
titles was involved.</p>

<p>The usual story, told in the <i>Historie</i>, of Columbus’
sojourn at the University of Pavia is
discredited, chiefly on the ground that Columbus
himself says that from a tender age he followed
the sea (but Columbus’ statements are often
inexact), and from the fact that in cosmography
Genoa had more to teach him than Pavia. Columbus
is also kept longer in Italy than the
received opinion has allowed, which has sent him
to Portugal about 1470; while we are now told&mdash;if
his identity is unassailable&mdash;that he was
in Savona as late as 1473 (pp. 253-254).</p>

<p>Documentary Portuguese evidence of Columbus’
connection with Portugal is scant. The
Archivo da Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, which
Santarem searched in vain for any reference
to Vespucius, seem to be equally barren of information
respecting Columbus, and they only
afford a few items regarding the family of the
Perestrellos (p. 44).</p>

<p>The principal contemporary Portuguese
chronicle making any reference to Columbus is
Ruy de Pina’s <i>Chronica del Rei Dom João II.</i>,
which is contained in the <i>Colleccão de livros ineditos
de historia Portugueza</i>, published at Lisbon
in 1792 (ii. 177), from which Garcia de Resende
seems to have borrowed what appears in his
<i>Choronica</i>, published at Lisbon in 1596; and
this latter account is simply paraphrased in the
<i>Decada primeira do Asia</i> (Lisbon, 1752) of
João de Barros, who, born in 1496, was too late
to have personal knowledge of earlier time of
the discoveries. Vasconcellos’ <i>Vida y acciones
del Rey D. Juan al segundo</i> (Madrid, 1639) adds
nothing.</p>

<p>The statement of the <i>Historie</i> again thrown
out, doubt at least is raised respecting the marriage
of Columbus with Philippa, daughter of
Bartholomeu Perestrello; and if the critic cannot
disprove such union, he seems to think that
as good, if not better, evidence exists for declaring
the wife of Columbus to have been the
daughter of Vasco Gil Moniz, of an old family,
while it was Vasco Gill’s sister Isabel who
married the Perestrello in question. The marriage
of Columbus took place, it is claimed
there is reason to believe, not in Madeira, as
Gomara and others have maintained, but in
Lisbon, and not before 1474. Further, discarding
the <i>Historie</i>, there is no evidence that Columbus
ever lived at Porto Santo or Madeira,
or that his wife was dead when he left Portugal
for Spain in 1484. If this is established, we
lose the story of the tie which bound him to
Portugal being severed by the death of his
companion; and the tale of his poring over
the charts of the dead father of his wife at
Porto Santo is relegated to the region of fable.</p>

<p>We have known that the correspondence of
Toscanelli with the monk Martinez took place
in 1474, and the further communication of the
Italian <i>savant</i> with Columbus himself has always
been supposed to have occurred soon
after; but reasons are now given for pushing
it forward to 1482.</p>

<p>The evidences of the offers which Columbus
made, or caused to be made, to England, France,
and Portugal,&mdash;to the latter certainly, and to the
two others probably,&mdash;before he betook himself
to Spain, are also reviewed. As to the embassy
to Genoa, there is no trace of it in the Genoese
Archives and no earlier mention of it than
Ramusio’s; and no Genoese authority repeats it
earlier than Casoni in his <i>Annali di Genova</i>, in
1708. This is now discredited altogether. No
earlier writer than Marin, in his <i>Storia del commercio
de’ Veneziani</i> (vol. vii. published 1800),
claims that Columbus gave Venice the opportunity
of embarking its fortunes with his; and
the document which Pesaro claimed to have seen
has never been found.</p>

<p>There is difficulty in fixing with precision
the time of Columbus’ leaving Portugal, if we reject
the statements of the <i>Historie</i>, which places
it in the last months of 1484. Other evidence
is here presented that in the summer of that
year he was in Lisbon; and no indisputable evidence
exists, in the critic’s judgment, of his being
in Spain till May, 1487, when a largess was
granted to him. Columbus’ own words would
imply in one place that he had taken service with
the Spanish monarchs in 1485, or just before
that date; and in another place that he had
been in Spain as early as January, 1484, or even
before,&mdash;a time when now it is claimed he is to
be found in Lisbon.</p>

<p>The pathetic story of the visit to Rábida
places that event at a period shortly after his
arriving in Spain; and the <i>Historie</i> tells also of
a second visit at a later day. It is now contended
that the two visits were in reality one, which occurred
in 1491. The principal argument to upset
the <i>Historie</i> is the fact that Juan Rodriguez
Cabezudo, in the lawsuit of 1513, testified that
it was “about twenty-two years” since he had
lent a mule to the Franciscan who accompanied
Columbus away from Rábida!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>With the same incredulity the critic spirits
away (p. 358) the junto of Salamanca. He can
find no earlier mention of it than that of Antonio
de Remesal in his <i>Historia de la Provincia de S.
Vincente de Chyapa</i>, published in Madrid in
1619; and accordingly asks why Las Casas, from
whom Remesal borrows so much, did not know
something of this junto? He counts for much
that Oviedo does not mention it; and the Archives
of the University at Salamanca throw no
light. The common story he believes to have
grown out of conferences which probably took
place while the Court was at Salamanca in the
winter of 1486-1487, and which were conducted
by Talavera; while a later one was held at Santa
Fé late in 1491, at which Cardinal Mendoza was
conspicuous.</p>

<p>Since Alexander Geraldinus, writing in 1522,
from his own acquaintance with Columbus, had
made the friar Juan Perez, of Rábida, and Antonio
de Marchena, who was Columbus’ steadfast
friend, one and the same person, it has been
the custom of historians to allow that Geraldinus
was right. It is now said he was in error;
but the critic confesses he cannot explain how
Gomara, abridging from Oviedo, changes the
name of Juan Perez used by the latter to Perez
de Marchena, and this before Geraldinus was
printed. Columbus speaks of a second monk
who had befriended him; and it has been the
custom to identify this one with Diego de Deza,
who, at the time when Columbus is supposed to
have stood in need of his support, had already
become a bishop, and was not likely, the critic
thinks, to have been called a monk by Columbus.
The two friendly monks in this view were
the two distinct persons Juan Perez and Antonio
de Marchena (p. 372).</p>

<p>The interposition of Cardinal Mendoza, by
which Columbus secured the royal ear, has
usually been placed in 1486. Oviedo seems to
have been the source of subsequent writers on
the point; but Oviedo does not fix the date,
and the critic now undertakes to show (p. 380)
that it was rather in the closing months of
1491.</p>

<p>Las Casas charges Talavera with opposing
the projects of Columbus: we have here (p. 383)
the contrary assertion; and the testimony of
Peter Martyr seems to sustain this view. So
again the new biographer measurably defends,
on other contemporary evidence, Fonseca (p. 386)
as not deserving the castigations of modern
writers; and all this objurgation is considered
to have been conveniently derived from the
luckless <i>Historie</i> of 1571.</p>

<p>The close student of Columbus is not unaware
of the unsteady character of much of the
discoverer’s own testimony on various points.
His imagination was his powerful faculty; and it
was as wild at times as it was powerful, and
nothing could stand in the way of it. No one
has emphasized the doleful story of his trials and
repressions more than himself, making the whole
world, except two monks, bent on producing his
ignominy; and yet his biographer can pick
(p. 388) from the Admiral’s own admissions
enough to show that during all this time he had
much encouragement from high quarters. The
critic is not slow to take advantage of this weakness
of Columbus’ character, and more than
once makes him the strongest witness against
himself.</p>

<p>It is now denied that the money advanced by
Santangel was from the treasury of Aragon. On
the contrary, the critic contends that the venture
was from Santangel’s private resources; and he
dismisses peremptorily the evidence of the document
which Argensola, in his <i>Anales de Aragon</i>
(Saragossa, 1630), says was preserved in the
archives of the treasury of Aragon. He says a
friend who searched at Barcelona in 1871, among
the “Archivo general de la Corona de Aragon,”
could not find it.</p>

<p>Las Casas had first told&mdash;guardedly, to be
sure&mdash;the story of the Pinzons’ contributing
the money which enabled Columbus to assume
an eighth part of the expense of the first voyage;
but it is now claimed that the assistance of that
family was confined to exerting its influence to
get Columbus a crew. It is judged that the
evidence is conclusive that the Pinzons did not
take pecuniary risk in the voyage of 1492, because
only their advances of this sort for the
voyage of 1499 are mentioned in the royal grant
respecting their arms. But such evidence is
certainly inconclusive; and without the evidence
of Las Casas it must remain uncertain whence
Columbus got the five hundred thousand maravedis
which he contributed to the cost of that
momentous voyage.</p>

<p>The world has long glorified the story in the
<i>Historie</i> of 1571 about the part which the crown
jewels, and the like, played in the efforts of
Isabella to assist in the furnishing of Columbus’
vessels. Peter Martyr, Bernaldez, and others
who took frequent occasion to sound the praises
of her majesty, say nothing of it; and, as is now
contended, for the good reason that there was
no truth in the story, the jewels having long
before been pledged in the prosecution of the
war with the Moors.</p>

<p>It is inferred (p. 417) from Las Casas that
his abridgment of Columbus’ Journal was made
from a copy, and not from the original (Navarrete,
i. 134); and Harrisse says that from two
copies of this abridgment, preserved in the collection
of the Duque d’Osuna at Madrid, Varnhagen
printed his text of it which is contained
in his <i>Verdadera Guanahani</i>. This last text
varies in some places from that in Navarrete,
and Harrisse says he has collated it with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Osuna copies without discovering any error.
He thinks, however, that the <i>Historie</i> of 1571, as
well as Las Casas’ account, is based upon the
complete text; and his discrediting of the <i>Historie</i>
does not prevent him in this case saying that
from it, as well as from Las Casas, a few touches
of genuineness, not of importance to be sure,
can be added to the narrative of the abridgment.
He also points out that we should discriminate
as to the reflections which Las Casas intersperses;
but he seems to have no apprehension
of such insertions in the <i>Historie</i> in this particular
case.</p>

<p>The Ambrosian text of the first letter is once
more reprinted (p. 419), accompanied by a
French translation. In some appended notes
the critic collates it with the Cosco version in
different shapes, and with that of Simancas.
He also suggests that this text was printed at
Barcelona toward the end of March, 1493, and
infers that it may have been in this form that
the Genoese ambassadors took the news to
Italy when they left Spain about the middle of
the following month.</p>

<p>The closing chapter of this first volume is on
the question of the landfall. The biographer
discredits attempts to settle the question by
nautical reasoning based on the log of Columbus,
averring that the inevitable inaccuracies of such
records in Columbus’ time is proved by the
widely different conclusions of such experienced
men as Navarrete, Becher, and Fox. He relies
rather on Columbus’ description and on that in
Las Casas. The name which the latter says was
borne in his day by the island of the landfall
was “Triango;” but the critic fails to find this
name on any earlier map than that first made
known in the <i>Cartas de Indias</i> in 1877. To this
map he finds it impossible to assign an earlier
date than 1541, since it discloses some reminders
of the expedition of Coronado. He instances
other maps in which the name in some form appears
attached to an island of the Bahamas,&mdash;as
in the Cabot mappemonde of 1544 (Triangula),
the so-called Vallard map (Triango), that of
Gutierrez in 1550 (Trriango), that of Alonso de
Santa Cruz in his <i>Islario</i> of 1560 (Triangulo).
Unfortunately on some of the maps Guanahani
appears as well as the name which Las Casas
gives. Harrisse’s solution of this conjunction
of names is suggested by the fact that in the
Weimar map of 1527 (see sketch, <i>ante</i>, p. 43) an
islet “Triango” lies just east of Guanahani, and
corresponds in size and position to the “Triangula”
of Cabot and the “Triangulo” of Santa
Cruz. Guanahani he finds to correspond to
Acklin Island, the larger of the Crooked Island
group (see map, <i>ante</i>, p. 55); while the Plana
Cays, shown east of it, would stand for “Triango.”
Columbus, with that confusion which
characterizes his writings, speaks in one place of
his first land being an “isleta,” and in another
place he calls it an “isla grande.” This gives
the critic ground for supposing that Columbus
saw first the islet, the “Triango” of Las Casas,
or the modern “Plana Cays,” and that then he
disembarked on the “isla grande,” which was
Acklin Island. So it may be that Columbus’
own confused statement has misled subsequent
writers. If this theory is not accepted, Fox, in
selecting Samana, has, in the critic’s opinion,
come nearer the truth than any other.</p>

ad nostram cognitionem hactenus pervenere; quibus addidimus, ubi locorum, quando
et a quibus excusi sunt,” which Ortelius in 1570 added to his <i>Theatrum orbis terrarum</i>,
many of whose titles belong to works not now known. Of maps now existing the best-known
enumerations are those in the <i>Jean et Sébastian Cabot</i> of Harrisse; the <i>Mapoteca
Colombiana</i> of Uricoechea; the <i>Cartografia Mexicana</i> of Orozco y Berra, published by the
Mexican Geographical Society; and Gustavo Uzielli’s <i>Elenco descritto degli Atlanti, planisferi
e carte nautiche</i>, originally published in 1875, but made the second volume, edited
by Pietro Amat, of the new edition of the <i>Studi biografici e bibliografici della Società
Geografica Italiana</i>, Rome, 1882, under the specific title of <i>Mappamondi, carte nautiche,
portolani ed altri monumenti cartografici specialmente Italiani dei secoli XIII-XVII</i>.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The Editor has printed in the <i>Harvard University Bulletin</i> a bibliography Of Ptolemy’s
geography, and a calendar, with additions and annotations, of the Kohl collection of early
maps, belonging to the Department of State at Washington, both of which contributions
called for enumerations of printed and manuscript maps of the early period, and included
their reproductions of later years.</p>

<p>The development of cartography is also necessarily made a part of histories of geography
like those of Santarem, Lelewel, St.-Martin, and Peschel; but their use of maps
hardly made chronological lists of them a necessary part of their works. Santarem has
pointed out how scantily modern writers have treated of the cartography of the Middle
Ages previous to the era of Spanish discovery; and he enumerates such maps as had been
described before the appearance of his work, as well as publications of the earlier ones
after the Spanish discovery.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>To what extent Columbus had studied the older maps from the time when they began
to receive a certain definiteness in the fourteenth century, is not wholly clear, nor how
much he knew of the charts of Marino Sanuto, of Pizignani, and of the now famous Catalan
map of that period; but it is doubtless
true that the maps of Bianco (1436)
and Mauro (1460) were well known to
him.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> “Though these early maps and

and confusion, it was on them that the
patient eye of Columbus had rested
through long hours of meditation, while
strenuous hope and unsubdued doubt
were struggling in his soul.”</p>

<p>A principal factor in the development
of map-making, as of navigation,
had been the magnet. It had been
brought from China to the eastern
coast of Africa as early as the fourth
century, and through the Arabs<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> and
Crusaders it had been introduced into
the Mediterranean, and was used by
the Catalans and Basques in the twelfth
century, a hundred years or more before
Marco Polo brought to Europe his
wonderful stories.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> In that century
even it had become so familiar a sight
that poets used it in their metaphors.
The variation of its needle was not
indeed unknown long before Columbus,
but its observation in mid-ocean
in his day gave it a new significance.
The Chinese had studied the phenomenon, and their observations upon it had
followed shortly upon the introduction of the compass itself to Western knowledge; and
as early as 1436 the variation of the needle was indicated on maps in connection with
places of observation.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest placing of a magnetic pole seems due to the voyage of Nicholas of Lynn,
whose narrative was presented to Edward III. of England. This account is no longer
known,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> though the title of it, <i>Inventio fortunata</i>, is preserved, with its alleged date of
1355. Cnoyen, whose treatise is not extant, is thought to have got his views about the
regions of the north and about the magnetic pole from Nicholas of Lynn,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> while he
was in Norway in 1364; and it is from Cnoyen that Mercator says he got his notion of
the four circumpolar islands which so long figured in maps of the Mercator and Finæus
school. In the Ruysch map (1508) we have the same four polar islands, with the magnetic
pole placed within an insular mountain north of Greenland. Ruysch also depended
on the <i>Inventio fortunata</i>. Later, by Martin Cortes in 1545, and by Sanuto in 1588, the
pole was placed farther south.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>Ptolemy, in the second century, accepting the generally received opinion that the
world as known was much longer east and west than north and south, adopted with this
theory the terms which naturally grew out of this belief, <i>latitude</i> and <i>longitude</i>, and first
instituted them, it is thought, in systematic geography.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Pierre d’Ailly, in his map of 1410,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> in marking his climatic lines, had indicated the beginnings,
under a revival of geographical inquiry, of a systematic notation of latitude. Several
of the early Ptolemies<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> had followed, by scaling in one way and another the distance from
the equator; while in the editions of 1508 and 1511 an example had been set of marking
longitude. The old Arabian cartographers had used both latitude and longitude; but
though there were some earlier indications of the adoption of such lines among the European
map-makers, it is generally accorded that the scales of such measurements, as we
understand them, came in, for both latitude and longitude, with the map which Reisch in
1503 annexed to his <i>Margarita philosophica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>Ptolemy had fixed his first meridian at the Fortunate Islands (Canaries), and in
the new era the Spaniards, with the sanction of the Pope, had adopted the same point;
though the Portuguese, as if in recognition of their own enterprise, had placed it
at Madeira,&mdash;as is shown in the globes of Behaim and Schöner, and in the map of
Ruysch. The difference was not great; the Ptolemean example prevailed, however, in
the end.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>In respect to latitude there was not in the rude instruments of the early navigators, and
under favorable conditions, the means of closely approximate accuracy. In the study
which the Rev. E. F. Slafter<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> has made on the average extent of the error which we find
in the records of even a later century, it appears that while a range of sixty geographical
miles will probably cover such errors in all cases, when observations were made with
ordinary care the average deviation will probably be found to be at least fifteen miles. The
fractions of degrees were scarcely ever of much value in the computation, and the minute
gradation of the instruments in use were subject to great uncertainty of record in tremulous
hands. It was not the custom,
moreover, to make any
allowance for the dip of the
horizon, for refraction or for
the parallax; and when, except
at the time of the equinox,
dependence had to be
placed upon tables of the
sun’s declination, the published
ephemerides, made for
a series of years, were the subjects
of accumulated error.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>With these impediments
to accurate results, it is not
surprising that even errors of
considerable extent crept into
the records of latitude, and
long remained unchallenged.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
Ptolemy, in <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 150, had
placed Constantinople two
degrees out of the way; and
it remained so on maps for
fourteen hundred years. In
Columbus’ time Cuba was
put seven or eight degrees
too far north; and under this
false impression the cartography
of the Antilles began.</p>

<p>The historic instrument for the taking of latitude was the astrolabe, which is known
to have been in use by the Majorcan and Catalanian sailors in the latter part of the thirteenth
century; and it is described by Raymond Lullius in his <i>Arte de navegar</i> of that time.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
Behaim, the contemporary of Columbus, one of the explorers of the African coast, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
pupil of Regiomontanus, had somewhat changed the old form of the astrolabe in adapting
it for use on shipboard. This was in 1484 at Lisbon, and Behaim’s improvement was
doubtless what Columbus used. Of the form in use before Behaim we have that (said to
have belonged to Regiomontanus) in the cut on page 96; and in the following cut the
remodelled shape which it took after Behaim.</p>

         <p class="pf400">This cut follows an engraving (<i>Mag. of
Amer. Hist.</i>, iii. 178) after a photograph of one
used by Champlain, which bears the Paris
maker’s date of 1603. There is another cut of
it in Weise’s <i>Discoveries of America</i>, p. 68. Having
been lost by Champlain in Canada in 1613, it
was ploughed up in 1867 (see Vol. IV. p. 124;
also <i>Canadian Monthly</i>, xviii. 589). The small
size of the circle used in the sea-instrument to
make it conveniently serviceable, necessarily operated
to make the ninety degrees of its quarter
circle too small for accuracy in fractions. On
land much larger circles were sometimes used;
one was erected in London in 1594 of six feet
radius. The early books on navigation and voyages
frequently gave engravings of the astrolabe;
as, for instance, in Pigafetta’s voyage (Magellan),
and in the <i>Lichte der Zee-Vaert</i> (Amsterdam,
1623), translated as <i>The Light of Navigation</i>
(Amsterdam, 1625). The treatise on navigation
which became the most popular with the successors
of Columbus was the work of Pedro de
Medina (born about 1493), called the <i>Arte de
navegar</i>, published in 1545 (reprinted in 1552 and
1561), of which there were versions in French
(1554, and Lyons, 1569, with maps showing names
on the coast of America for the first time),
Italian (1555 with 1554, at end; <i>Court Catalogue</i>,
no. 235), German (1576), and English (1591).
(Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 266.) Its principal
rival was that of Martin Cortes, <i>Breve compendio
de la sphera y de la arte de navegar</i>, published
in 1551. In Columbus’ time there was no
book of the sort, unless that of Raymond Lullius
(1294) be considered such; and not till Enciso’s
<i>Suma de geografia</i> was printed, in 1519, had the
new spirit instigated the making of these helpful
and explanatory books. The <i>Suma de geografia</i>
is usually considered the first book printed in
Spanish relating to America. Enciso, who had
been practising law in Santo Domingo, was with
Ojeda’s expedition to the mainland in 1509,
and seems to have derived much from his varied
experience; and he first noticed at a later day
the different levels of the tides on the two sides
of the isthmus. The book is rare; Rich in
1832 (no. 4) held it at £10 10<i>s.</i> (Cf. Harrisse,
<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, 171; <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, nos.
97, 153, 272,&mdash;there were later editions in 1530
and 1546,&mdash;Sabin, vol. vi. no. 22,551, etc.; H. H.
Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, i. 329, 339; Carter-Brown,
vol. i. no. 58, with a fac-simile of the
title: <i>Cat. Hist. do Brazil, Bibl. Nac. do Rio
de Janeiro</i>, no. 2.) Antonio Pigafetta in 1530
produced his <i>Trattato di navigazione</i>; but Medina
and Cortes were the true beginners of the
literature of seamanship. (Cf. Brevoort’s <i>Verrazano</i>,
p. 116, and the list of such publications
given in the <i>Davis Voyages</i>, p. 342, published by
the Hakluyt Society, and the English list noted
in Vol. III. p. 206, of the present <i>History</i>.)
There is an examination of the state of navigation
in Columbus’ time in Margry’s <i>Navigations
Françaises</i>, p. 402, and in M. F. Navarrete’s
<i>Sobre la historia de la náutica y de las ciencias
matemáticas</i>, Madrid, 1846,&mdash;a work now become
rare.</p>

<p class="pf400">The rudder, in place of two paddles, one
on each quarter, had come into use before this
time; but the reefing of sails seems not yet to
have been practised. (Cf. <i>De Gama’s Voyages</i>,
published by the Hakluyt Society, p. 242.)
Columbus’ record of the speed of his ship
seems to have been the result of observation by
the unaided eye. The log was not yet known;
the Romans had fixed a wheel to the sides of
their galleys, each revolution of which threw a
pebble into a tally-pot. The earliest description
which we have in the new era of any device of
the kind is in connection with Magellan’s voyage;
for Pigafetta in his Journal (January, 1521),
mentions the use of a chain at the hinder part
of the ship to measure its speed. (Humboldt,
<i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. tr., ii. 631; v. 56.) The log as
we understand it is described in 1573 in Bourne’s
<i>Regiment of the Sea</i>, nothing indicating the use
of it being found in the earlier manuals of
Medina, Cortes, and Gemma Frisius. Humfrey
Cole is said to have invented it. Three
years later than this earliest mention, Eden, in
1576, in his translation of Taisnier’s <i>Navigatione</i>,
alludes to an artifice “not yet divulgate, which,
placed in the pompe of a shyp, whyther the
water hath recourse, and moved by the motion
of the shypp, with wheels and weyghts, doth
exactly shewe what space the shyp hath gone”
(<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. no. 310),&mdash;a reminiscence
of the Roman side-wheels, and a reminder
of the modern patent-log. Cf. article
on “Navigation” in <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>,
ninth ed. vol. xvii.</p>

<p>An instrument which could more readily adapt itself to the swaying of the observer’s
body in a sea-way, soon displaced in good measure the astrolabe on shipboard. This
was the cross-staff, or jackstaff, which in several modified forms for a long time served
mariners as a convenient help in ascertaining the altitude of the celestial bodies. Precisely
when it was first introduced is not certain; but the earliest description of it which
has been found is that of Werner in 1514. Davis, the Arctic navigator, made an improvement
on it; and his invention was called a backstaff.</p>

<p>While the observations of the early navigators in respect to latitude were usually
accompanied by errors, which were of no considerable extent, their determinations of
longitude, when attempted at all, were almost always wide of the truth,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>&mdash;so far, indeed,
that their observations helped them but little then to steer their courses, and are of small
assistance now to us in following their tracks. It happened that while Columbus was
at Hispaniola on his second voyage, in September, 1494, there was an eclipse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
moon.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Columbus observed it; and his calculations placed himself five hours and a half
from Seville,&mdash;an error of eighteen degrees, or an hour and a quarter too much. The
error was due doubtless as much to the rudeness of his instruments as to the errors of
the lunar tables then in use.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>The removal of the Line of
Demarcation from the supposed
meridian of non-variation of the
needle did not prevent the phenomena
of terrestrial magnetism
becoming of vast importance in
the dispute between the Crowns
of Spain and Portugal. It characterizes
the difference between
the imaginative and somewhat
fantastic quality of Columbus’
mind and the cooler, more practical,
and better administrative
apprehension of Sebastian Cabot,
that while each observed the
phenomenon of the variation of
the needle, and each imagined it
a clew to some system of determining
longitude, to Columbus it
was associated with wild notions
of a too-ample revolution of the
North Star about the true pole.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> It was not disconnected in his mind from a fancy which
gave the earth the shape of a pear; so that when he perceived on his voyage a clearing of
the atmosphere, he imagined he was ascending the stem-end of the pear; where he would
find the terrestrial paradise.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> To Cabot the phenomenon had only its practical significance;
and he seems to have pondered on a solution of the problem during the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his life, if, as Humboldt supposes, the intimations of his death-bed in respect to some
as yet unregistered way of discovering longitude refer to his observations on the
magnetic declination.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>The idea of a constantly increasing declination
east and west from a point of non-variation,
which both Columbus and Cabot had
discovered, and which increase could be reduced
to a formula, was indeed partly true;
except, as is now well known, the line of
non-variation, instead of being a meridian,
and fixed, is a curve of constantly changing
proportions.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

of ascertaining longitude were at once based
on the observations of these curves, as they

<p>The earliest map which is distinctively associated with the views which were developing
in Columbus’ mind was the one which Toscanelli sent to him in 1474. It is said to have
been preserved in Madrid in 1527;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and fifty-three years after Columbus’ death, when Las

geographer had reduced the circumference of the globe to nearly three quarters of its
actual size, having placed China about six thousand five hundred miles west of Lisbon,
and eleven thousand five hundred miles east. Japan, lying off the China coast, was put
somewhere from one hundred degrees to one hundred and ten degrees west of Lisbon;
and we have record that Martin Pinzon some years later (1491) saw a map in Rome

<p>It has always been supposed that in the
well-known globe of Martin Behaim we get in the main an expression of the views held
by Toscanelli, Columbus, and other of Behaim’s contemporaries, who espoused the notion
of India lying over against Europe.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes, accepting the spherical theory, had advanced the identical notion
which nearly seventeen hundred years later impelled Columbus to his voyage. He held
the known world to span
one third of the circuit of
the globe, as Strabo did at
a later day, leaving an unknown
two thirds of sea;
and “if it were not that
the vast extent of the Atlantic
Sea rendered it impossible,
one might even sail
from the coast of Spain
to that of India along the
same parallel.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Behaim had spent much
of his life in Lisbon and the
Azores, and was a friend of
Columbus. He had visited
Nuremberg, probably on
some family matters arising
out of the death of his
mother in 1487. While
in this his native town, he
gratified some of his townspeople
by embodying in
a globe the geographical
views which prevailed in the
maritime countries; and the
globe was finished before
Columbus had yet accomplished
his voyage. The
next year (1493) Behaim returned to Portugal; and after having been sent to the Low
Countries on a diplomatic mission, he was captured by English cruisers and carried to
England. Escaping finally, and reaching the Continent, he passes from our view in 1494,
and is scarcely heard of again.</p>

surface received the drawing; it is twenty
inches in diameter. It having fallen into decay,
the Behaim family in Nuremberg caused it to be
repaired in 1825. In 1847 a copy was made of it
for the Dépôt Géographique (National Library)
at Paris; the original is now in the city hall at
Nuremberg. The earliest known engraving of
it is in J. G. Doppelmayr’s <i>Historische Nachricht
von den nürnbergischen Mathematikern und Künstlern</i>
(1730), which preserved some names that
have since become illegible (Stevens, <i>Historical

<p>Of Columbus’ maps it is probable that nothing has come down to us from his own
hand.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Humboldt would fain believe that the group of islands studding a gulf which
appears on a coat-of-arms granted Columbus in May, 1493, has some interest as the
earliest of all cartographical records of the New World; but the early drawings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
arms are by no means constant in the kind of grouping which is given to these islands.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
Queen Isabella, writing to the Admiral, Sept. 5, 1493, asks to see the marine chart which
he had made; and Columbus sent such a map with a letter.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> We have various other
references to copies of this or similar
charts of Columbus. Ojeda used such
a one in following Columbus’ route,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> as
he testified in the famous suit against the
heirs of Columbus. Bernardo de Ibarra,
in the same cause, said that he had seen
the Admiral’s chart, and that he had
heard of copies of it being used by
Ojeda, and by some others.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> It is known
that about 1498 Columbus gave one of his
charts to the Pope, and one to René of
Lorraine. Angelo Trivigiano, secretary
of the Venetian Ambassador to Spain,
in a letter dated Aug. 21, 1501, addressed
to Dominico Malipiero, speaks of a map
of the new discoveries which Columbus
had.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Three or four maps at least have
come down to us which are supposed to
represent in some way one or several of
these drafts by Columbus. The first of
these is the celebrated map of the pilot
Juan de la Cosa,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> dated in 1500, of which
some account, with a heliotype fac-simile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the American part of the map, is given in another place.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> After the death (April 27,
1852) of Walckenaer (who had bought it at a moderate cost of an ignorant dealer in
second-hand articles), it was sold at public auction in Paris in the spring of 1853, when
Jomard failed to secure it for the Imperial Library in Paris, and it went to Spain, where,
in the naval museum at Madrid, it now is.</p>

<p>Of the next earliest of the American maps the story has recently been told with great
fulness by Harrisse in his <i>Les Cortereal</i>, accompanied by a large colored fac-simile of the
map itself, executed by Pilinski. The map was not unknown before,<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and Harrisse had
earlier described it in his <i>Cabots</i>.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>We know that Gaspar Cortereal<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> had already before 1500 made some explorations,
during which he had discovered a mainland and some islands, but at what precise date
it is impossible to determine;<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> nor can we decide upon the course he had taken, but it
seems likely it was a westerly one. We know also that in this same year (1500) he
made his historic voyage to the Newfoundland region,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> coasting the neighboring shores,
probably, in September and October. Then followed a second expedition from January
to October of the next year (1501),&mdash;the one of which we have the account in the <i>Paesi
novamente retrovati</i>, as furnished by Pasqualigo.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> There was at this time in Lisbon
one Alberto Cantino, a correspondent&mdash;with precisely what quality we know not&mdash;of
Hercule d’Este, Duke of Ferrara; and to this noble personage Cantino, on the 19th of
October, addressed a letter embodying what he had seen and learned of the newly
returned companions of Gaspar Cortereal.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>The Report of Cantino instigated the Duke to ask his correspondent to procure for him
a map of these explorations. Cantino procured one to be made; and inscribing it, “Carta
da navigar per le Isole novam<sup>te</sup> tr.... in le parte de l’India: dono Alberto Cantino Al
S. Duca Hercole,” he took it to Italy, and delivered it by another hand to the Duke at
Ferrara. Here in the family archives it was preserved till 1592, when the reigning Duke
retired to Modena, his library following him. In 1868, in accordance with an agreement
between the Italian Government and the Archduke Francis of Austria, the cartographical
monuments of the ducal collection were transferred to the Biblioteca Estense, where this
precious map now is. The map was accompanied when it left Cantino’s hands by a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
addressed to the Duke and dated at Rome, Nov. 19, 1502,<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> which fortunately for us fixes
very nearly the period of the construction of the map. A much reduced sketch is
annexed.</p>

<p>For the northern coast of South America La Cosa and Cantino’s draughtsmen seem
to have had different authorities. La Cosa attaches forty-five names to that coast: Cantino
only twenty-nine; and only three of them are common to the two.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Harrisse

coast of the United States (here represented in the north and south trend of shore, north
of Cuba), that there was existing in October, 1500, at least in Spanish circles, no knowledge
of it,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> but that explorations must have taken place before the summer of 1502 which afforded
the knowledge embodied in this Cantino map. This coast was not visited, so far as is
positively known, by any Spanish expedition previous to 1502. Besides the eight Spanish
voyages of this period (not counting the problematical one of Vespucius) of which we have
documentary proof, there were doubtless others of which we have intimations; but we
know nothing of their discoveries, except so far as those before 1500 may be embodied in
La Cosa’s chart.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> The researches of Harrisse have failed to discover in Portugal any
positive trace of voyages made from that kingdom in 1501, or thereabout, records of which
have been left in the Cantino map. Humboldt had intimated that in Lisbon at that time
there was a knowledge of the connection of the Antilles with the northern discoveries of
Cortereal by an intervening coast; but Harrisse doubts if Humboldt’s authority&mdash;which
seems to have been a letter of Pasqualigo sent to Venice, dated Oct. 18, 1501, found in the
<i>Diarii</i> of Marino Sanuto, a manuscript preserved in Vienna&mdash;means anything more
than a conjectural belief in such connection. Harrisse’s conclusion is that between the
close of 1500 and the summer of 1502, some navigators, of whose names and nation we
are ignorant, but who were probably Spanish, explored the coast of the present United
States from Pensacola to the Hudson. This Atlantic coast of Cantino terminates at
about 59° north latitude, running nearly north and south from the Cape of Florida to that
elevation. Away to the east in mid-ocean, and placed so far easterly as doubtless to appear
on the Portuguese side of the Line of Demarcation, and covering from about fifty to fifty-nine
degrees of latitude, is a large island which stands for the discoveries of Cortereal,
“Terra del Rey du Portuguall;” and northeast of this is the point of Greenland apparently,
with Iceland very nearly in its proper place.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> This Cantino map, now positively fixed in
1502, establishes the earliest instance of a kind of delineation of North America which prevailed
for some time. Students of this early cartography have long supposed this geographical
idea to date from about this time, and have traced back the origin of what is
known as “The Admiral’s Map”<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> to data accumulated in the earliest years of the sixteenth
century. Indeed Lelewel,<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> thirty years ago, made up what he called a Portuguese
chart of 1501-1504, by combining in one draft the maps of the 1513 Ptolemy, with a hint
or two from the Sylvanus map of 1511, acting on the belief that the Portuguese were the
real first pursuers, or at least recorders, of explorations of the Floridian peninsula and of
the coast northerly.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

American coast (north part) are carried no
farther than Ojeda went in 1499, and no farther
south than Vespucius went in 1503; while the
connection made of the two Americas was probably
conjectural. Other fac-similes of the map
are given in Varnhagen’s <i>Premier voyage de Vespucci</i>,
in Weise’s <i>Discoveries of America</i>, p. 124;
and in Stevens’s <i>Historical and Geographical

Wieser, in his <i>Magalhâes-Strasse</i> (Innsbruck,
1881), p. 15, mentions a manuscript note-book
of Schöner, the globe-maker, preserved in the
Hof-bibliothek at Vienna, which has a sketch
resembling this 1513 map. Harrisse (<i>Les Cortereal</i>,
pp. 122, 126) has pointed out the correspondence
of its names to the Cantino map,
though the Waldseemüller map has a few names
which are not on the Cantino. Again, Harrisse
(<i>Les Cortereal</i>, p. 128) argues from the fact
that the relations of Duke René with Portugal
were cordial, while they were not so with Spain,
and from the resemblance of René’s map in the
Ptolemy of 1513 to that of Cantino, that the
missing map upon which Waldseemüller is said
to have worked to produce, with René’s help,
the so-called “Admiral’s map,” was the original
likewise of that of Cantino.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The earliest Spanish map after that of La Cosa which has come down to us is the
one which is commonly known as Peter Martyr’s map. It is a woodcut measuring 11 ×
7½ inches, and is usually thought to have first appeared in the <i>Legatio Babylonica</i>, or
Martyr’s first decade, at Seville, 1511; but Harrisse is inclined to believe that the map did
not originally belong to Martyr’s book, because three copies of it in the original vellum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
which he has examined do not have the map. Quaritch<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> says that copies vary, that the
leaf containing the map is an insertion, and that it is sometimes on different folios. Thus
of two issues, one is called a second, because two leaves seem to have been reprinted to
correct errors, and two new leaves are inserted, and a new title is printed. It is held by
some that the map properly belongs to this issue. Brevoort<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> thinks that the publication
of the map was distasteful to the Spanish Government (since the King this same year
forbade maps being given to foreigners); and he argues that the scarcity of the book may

<p>The maker of the 1513 map as we have it was Waldseemüller, or Hylacomylus, of St.
Dié, in the Vosges Mountains; and Lelewel<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> gives reasons for believing that the plate had
been engraved, and that copies were on sale as early as 1507. It had been engraved at the
expense of Duke René II. of Lorraine, from information furnished by him to perfect some
anterior chart; but the plate does not seem to have been used in any book before it appeared
in this 1513 edition of Ptolemy.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> It bears along the coast this legend: “Hec
terra adjacentibus insulis inventa est per Columbū ianuensem ex mandato Regis Castelle;”
and in the Address to the Reader in the Supplement appears the following sentence,
in which the connection of Columbus with the map is thought to be indicated: “Charta
antē marina quam Hydrographiam vocant per Admiralem [? <i>Columbus</i>] quondam serenissi.
Portugalie [? <i>Hispaniæ</i>] regis Ferdinandi ceteros denique lustratores verissimis pagratiōibus
lustrata, ministerio Renati, dum vixit, nunc pie mortui, Ducis illustris. Lotharingie

<p>This “Admiral’s map” seems to have been closely followed in the map which Gregor
Reisch annexed to his popular encyclopædia,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> the <i>Margarita philosophica</i>, in 1515; though
there is some difference in the coast-names, and the river mouths and deltas on the coast
west of Cuba are left out.</p>

         <p class="pf400">There is another fac-simile in Stevens’s
<i>Historical and Geographical Notes</i>, pl. 4. An
edition of Reisch appeared at Freiburg in 1503
(Murphy, no. 3,089); but in 1504 there were
two editions, with a mappemonde which had no
other reference to America than in the legend:
“Hic non terra sed mare est in quo miræ magnitudinis
insulæ sed Ptolemæo fuerunt incognitæ.”
Some copies are dated 1505. (Murphy,
no. 3,090.) A copy dated 1508, Basle, “cum additionibus
novis” (Quaritch, no. 12,363; Baer’s
<i>Incunabeln</i>, 1884, no. 64, at 36 marks; and Murphy,
no. 2,112*) had the same map. The 1515
edition had the map above given. (Harrisse,
<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 82; <i>Additions</i>, no. 45,
noting a copy in the Imperial Library at Vienna.
Kohl copies in his Washington Collection from
one in the library at Munich.) The Basle edition
of 1517 has a still different woodcut map.
(Beckford, <i>Catalogue</i>, vol. iii. no. 1,256; Murphy,
no. 2,112**.) Not till 1535 did an edition have
any reference to America in the text. (<i>Bibl.

of 1583, Basle, with a mappamonde showing
America. (Leclerc, no. 2,926.) Cf. further in

<p>Stevens and others have contended that this represents
Columbus’ Ganges; but Varnhagen makes it stand for the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi,&mdash;a
supposition more nearly like Reisch’s interpretation, as will be seen by his
distinct separation of the new lands from Asia. Reisch is, however, uncertain of their
western limits, which are cut off by the scale, as shown in the map; while on the other
side of the same scale Cipango is set down in close proximity to it.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that it was a map of this type which Bartholomew Columbus,
when he visited Rome in 1505, gave to a canon of St. John Lateran, together with one
of the printed accounts of his brother’s voyage; and this canon gave the map to Alessandro
Strozzi, “suo amico e compilatore della raccolta,” as is stated in a marginal note in
a copy of the <i>Mundus novus</i> in the Magliabecchian library.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>Columbus is said to have had a vision before his fourth voyage, during which he saw
and depicted on a map a strait between the regions north and south of the Antillian Sea.
De Lorgues, with a convenient alternative for his saintly hero, says that the mistake was
only in making the strait of water, when it should have been of land!</p>

(of which Wieser gives the above sketch

his globe, which is extremely rare. Wieser reports
copies in the great libraries of Vienna and

Vienna copy, at St. Petersburg in 1872 (forty
copies only), under the designation, <i>Réimpression
fidèle d’une lettre de Jean Schöner, à propos de
son globe, écrite en 1523</i>. The Latin is given
in Wieser’s <i>Magalhâes-Strasse</i>, p. 118. Johann
Schoner or Schöner (for the spelling varies) was
born in 1477, and died in 1547. The testimony
of this globe to an early knowledge of the straits
afterward made known by Magellan is examined
on a later page. The notions which long
prevailed respecting a large Antarctic continent
are traced in Wieser’s <i>Magalhâes-Strasse</i>, p. 59,

<p>It seems from its resemblance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the La Cosa chart to have been kept much nearer the Columbian draft than the geographer
of St. Dié, with his Portuguese helps, was contented to leave it in his map. In La
Cosa the vignette of St.
Christopher had concealed
the mystery of a westerly
passage;<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Ruysch assumes
it, or at least gives no intimation
of his belief in the
inclosure of the Antillian
Sea. Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> has pointed
out how an entirely different
coast-nomenclature in
the two maps points to different
originals of the two
map-makers. The text of
this 1508 edition upon
“Terra Nova” and “Santa
Cruz” is by Marcus Beneventanus.
There are reasons
to believe that the map
may have been issued separately,
as well as in the
book; and the copies of the
map in the Barlow Collection
and in Harvard College
Library are perhaps of this
separate issue.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

The Stobnicza map&mdash;published

<p>The Schöner globe of 1515, often cited as the Frankfort globe; the Schöner globe of
1520; the so-called Tross gores of 1514-1519; the map of Petrus Apianus<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>&mdash;or Bienewitz,
as he was called in his vernacular&mdash;which
appeared in the <i>Polyhistoria</i>
of Solinus, edited by the Italian
monk Camers, and also in 1522 in
the <i>De orbis situ</i> of Pomponius Mela,
published by Vadianus,&mdash;all preserve
the same characteristics with
the St. Dié map, excepting that they
show the western passage referred
to in Columbus’ dream, and so far
unite some of the inferences from
the map of Ruysch. There was a
curious survival of this Cantino type,
particularly as regards North America
for many years yet to come, as
seen in the map which Münster
added to the Basle edition of the
<i>Novus orbis</i> in 1532 and 1537, and
in the drawing which Jomard gives<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
as from “une cassette de la Collection
Trivulci, dite Cassettina all’Agemina.”
This last drawing is a
cordiform mappemonde, very like
another which accompanied Honter’s
<i>Rudimenta cosmographica</i> in
1542, and which was repeated in various
editions to as late a period as
1590. Thus it happened that for
nearly a century geographical views
which the earliest navigators evolved,
continued in popular books to convey
the most inadequate notion of
the contour of the new continent.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>In the same year with the publication of the Peter Martyr map of 1511, an edition of
Ptolemy, published at Venice and edited by Bernardus Sylvanus, contained a mappemonde
on a cordiform projection,&mdash;which
is said to be the
first instance of the use
of this method in drafting
maps. What is shown
of the new discoveries is
brought in a distorted
shape on the extreme western
verge of the map; and
to make the contour more
intelligible, it is reduced in
the sketch annexed to an
ordinary plane projection.
It is the earliest engraved
map to give any trace of the
Cortereal discoveries<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> and
to indicate the Square, or
St. Lawrence, Gulf. It
gives a curious Latinized
form to the name of the
navigator himself in “Regalis
Domus” (Cortereal),
and restores Greenland, or
Engronelant, to a peninsular
connection with northwestern
Europe as it had
appeared in the Ptolemy
of 1482.</p>

<p>If deprived of the associations

<p class="pc1 mid">AMERIGO VESPUCCI.</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AMERIGO VESPUCCI,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> the third son of Nastugio Vespucci, a notary
of Florence, and his wife Lisabetta Mini, was born on the 9th of
March, 1451. The family had the respectability of wealth, acquired in trade,
for one member of it in the preceding century was rich enough to endow
a public hospital. Over the portal of the house, so dedicated to charity by
this pious Vespucci nearly three quarters of a century before Amerigo was
born, there was, says Humboldt, engraved in 1719, more than three hundred
years after the founding of the hospital, an inscription declaring that
here Amerigo had lived in his youth. As the monks, however, who wrote
the inscription also asserted in it that he was the discoverer of America,
it is quite possible that they may have been as credulous in the one case as
in the other, and have accepted for fact that which was only tradition. But
whether Amerigo’s father, Nastugio, lived or did not live in the hospital
which his father or grandfather founded, he evidently maintained the
respectability of the family. Three of his sons he sent to be educated
at the University of Pisa. Thenceforth they are no more heard of, except
that one of them, Jerome, afterward went to Palestine, where he remained
nine years, met with many losses, and endured much suffering,&mdash;all of which
he related in a letter to his younger brother Amerigo. But the memory
even of this Jerome&mdash;that he should have ever gone anywhere, or had any
adventures worth the telling&mdash;is only preserved from oblivion because he
had this brother who became the famous navigator, and whose name by
a chance was given to half the globe.</p>

<p>Amerigo was not sent to the university. Such early education as he
received came from a learned uncle, Giorgi Antonio Vespucci, a Dominican
friar, who must have been a man of some influence in Florence, as it is
claimed for him that he was the friend and colleague of the more famous
monk Savonarola. The nephew acknowledged later in life that he was not
among the most diligent of his uncle’s pupils; and the admission was as
true as it was ingenuous, if one may judge by a letter in Latin written, when
he was twenty-five years old, to his father. He excuses himself to that
<i>spectabili et egregio viro</i>&mdash;as he addresses his father&mdash;for recent negligence
in writing, as he hesitates to commit himself in Latin without the revision
of his uncle, and he happens to be absent. Probably it was poverty of
expression in that tongue, and not want of thought, which makes the letter
seem the work of a boy of fifteen rather than of a young man of five and
twenty. A mercantile career in preference to that of a student was, at any
rate, his own choice; and in due time, though at what age precisely does
not appear, a place was found for him in the great commercial house of the
Princes Medici in Florence.</p>

<p>In Florence he remained, apparently in the service of the Medici, till
1490; for in that year he complains that his mother prevented him from
going to Spain. But the delay was not long, as in January, 1492, he writes
from Cadiz, where he was then engaged in trade with an associate, one
Donato Nicolini,&mdash;perhaps as agents of the Medici, whose interests in Spain
were large. Four years later, the name of Vespucci appears for the first
time in the Spanish archives, when he was within two months of being forty-six
years of age. Meanwhile he had engaged in the service of Juonato
Berardi, a Florentine merchant established at Seville, who had fitted out
the second expedition of Columbus in 1493.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>It has been conjectured that Vespucci became known at that time to
Columbus,&mdash;which is not improbable if the former was so early as 1493 in
the service of Berardi. But the suggestion that he went with Columbus either
on his first or second expedition cannot be true, at any rate as to the
second.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> For in 1495 Berardi made a contract with the Spanish Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to furnish a fleet of ships for an expedition westward which he did not live
to complete. Its fulfilment was intrusted to Vespucci; and it appears in
the public accounts that a sum of money was paid to him from the Treasury
of the State in January, 1496. Columbus was then absent on his second
voyage, begun in September, 1493, from which he did not return till June,
1496.</p>

<p>In the interval between the spring of 1495 and the summer of 1497 any
adventurer was permitted by Spain, regardless of the agreement made with
Columbus, to go upon voyages of commerce or discovery to that New India
to which his genius and courage had led the way. “Now,” wrote Columbus,
“there is not a man, down to the very tailors, who does not beg to be allowed
to become a discoverer.” The greed of the King; the envy of the navigators
who before 1492 had laughed at the theories of Columbus; the hatred
of powerful Churchmen, more bitter now than ever, because those theories
which they had denounced as heresy had proved to be true,&mdash;all these
influences were against him, and had combined to rob the unhappy Admiral,
even before he had returned from his second voyage, of the honor and the
riches which he thought would rightfully become his own. Ships now
could go and come in safety over that wide waste of waters which even
children could remember had been looked upon as a “Sea of Darkness,”
rolling westward into never-ending space, whence there was no return to
the voyager mad enough to trust to its treacherous currents. It was no
longer guarded by perpetual Night, by monsters hideous and terrible, and
by a constant wind that blew ever toward the west. But ships came safely
back, bringing, not much, but enough of gold and pearls to seem an earnest
of the promise of the marvellous wealth of India that must soon be so easily
and so quickly reached; with the curious trappings of a picturesque barbarism;
the soft skins and gorgeous feathers of unknown beasts and birds;
the woods of a new beauty in grain and vein and colors; the aromatic herbs
of subtle virtue that would stir the blood beneath the ribs of Death; and with
all these precious things the captive men and women, of curious complexion
and unknown speech, whose people were given as a prey to the stranger by
God and the Pope. Every rough sailor of these returning ships was greeted
as a hero when to the gaping, wide-eyed crowd he told of his adventures in
that land of perpetual summer, where the untilled virgin soil brought forth
its fruits, and the harvest never failed; where life was without care or toil,
sickness or poverty; where he who would might gather wealth as he would
idly pick up pebbles on a beach. These were the sober realities of the
times; and there were few so poor in spirit or so lacking in imagination
as not to desire to share in the possession of these new Indies. It was not
long, indeed, before a reaction came; when disappointed adventurers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
returned in poverty, and sat in rags at the gates of the palace to beg
relief of the King. And when the sons of Columbus, who were pages in
the Court of the Queen, passed by, “they shouted to the very heavens,
saying: ‘Look at the sons of the Admiral of Mosquitoland!&mdash;of that
man who has discovered the lands of deceit and disappointment,&mdash;a place
of sepulchre and wretchedness to Spanish hidalgos!’”<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>From his second voyage Columbus returned in the summer of 1496; and
meeting his enemies with the courage and energy which never failed him,
he induced the King and Queen to revoke, in June of the next year, the
decree of two years before. Meanwhile he made preparations for his third
voyage, on which he sailed from San Lucar on the 30th of May, 1498. Two
months later he came in sight of the island he named Trinidad; and entering
the Gulf of Paria, into which empties the Orinoco by several mouths,
he sailed along the coast of the mainland. He had reached the continent,
not of Asia, as he supposed, but of the western hemisphere. None of the
four voyages of the great discoverer is so illustrative of his peculiar faith,
his religious fervor, and the strength of his imagination as this third voyage;
and none, in that respect, is so interesting. The report of it which he sent
home in a letter, with a map, to the King and Queen has a direct relation
to the supposed first voyage of Amerigo Vespucci.</p>

<p>As he approached the coast, Columbus wrote,<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> he heard “in the dead
of night an awful roaring;” and he saw “the sea rolling from west to east
like a mountain as high as the ship, and approaching little by little; on the
top of this rolling sea came a mighty wave roaring with a frightful noise.”
When he entered the Gulf, and saw how it was filled by the flow of the great
river, he believed that he had witnessed far out at sea the mighty struggle
at the meeting of the fresh with the salt water. The river, he was persuaded,
must be rushing down from the summit of the earth, where the Lord had
planted the earthly Paradise, in the midst whereof was a fountain whence
flowed the four great rivers of the world,&mdash;the Ganges, the Tigris, the
Euphrates, and the Nile. He did not quite agree with those earlier philosophers
who believed that the earth was a perfect sphere; but rather that
it was like “the form of a pear, which is very round except where the stalk
grows, at which part it is most prominent; or like a round ball, upon one
part of which is a prominence like a woman’s nipple, this protrusion being
the highest and nearest the sky, situated under the equinoctial line, and at
the eastern extremity of this sea.” “I call that the eastern extremity,” he
adds, “where the land and the islands end.”</p>

<p>Now had come to him at last in the observations and experience of this
voyage the confirmation of his faith. That “eastern extremity of the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
where the lands and the islands end” he had reached, he thought, at the
islands of Trinidad, of Margarita, and of Cubagua, and at the coast of
the Gulf of Paria, into which poured this great river rushing down from
the pinnacle of the globe. For he had observed, as he sailed westward
from a certain line in the ocean, that “the ships went on rising smoothly
towards the sky.” Some of the older astronomers, he said, believed that
the Arctic pole was “the highest point of the world, and nearest to the
heavens;” and others that this was true of the Antarctic. Though all were
wrong as to the exact locality of that elevation, it was plain that they held
a common faith that somewhere there was a point of exaltation, if only it
could be found, where the earth approached the sky more nearly than anywhere
else. But it had not occurred to any of them that possibly the
blessed spot which the first rays of the sun lit up in crimson and in gold
on the morning of creation, because it was the topmost height of the globe,
and because it was in the east, might be under the equinoctial line; and
it had not occurred to them, because this eastern extremity of the world,
which it had pleased God he should now discover, had hitherto been
unknown to civilized man.</p>

<p>Every observation and incident of this voyage gave to Columbus
proof of the correctness of his theory. The farther south he had gone
along the African coast, the blacker and more barbarous he had found the
people, the more intense the heat, and the more arid the soil. For many
days they had sailed under an atmosphere so heated and oppressive that
he doubted if his ships would not fall to pieces and their crews perish,
if they did not speedily escape into some more temperate region. He had
remarked in former voyages that at a hundred leagues west of the Azores
there was a north-and-south line, to cross which was to find an immediate
and grateful change in the skies above, in the waters beneath, and in the
reviving temperature of the air. The course of the ships was altered
directly westward, that this line might be reached, and the perils escaped
which surrounded him and his people. It was when the line was crossed
that he observed how his ships were gently ascending toward the skies.
Not only were the expected changes experienced, but the North Star
was seen at a new altitude; the needle of the compass varied a point,
and the farther they sailed the more it turned to the northwest. However
the wind blew, the sea was always smooth; and when the Island
of Trinidad and the shores of the continent were reached, they entered
a climate of exceeding mildness, where the fields and the foliage were
“remarkably fresh and green, and as beautiful as the gardens of Valencia
in April.” The people who crowded to the shore “in countless numbers”
to gaze at these strange visitors were “very graceful in form,
tall, and elegant in their movements, wearing their hair very long and
smooth.” They were, moreover, of a whiter skin than any the Admiral
had heretofore seen “in any of the Indies,” and were “shrewd, intelligent,
and courageous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The more he saw and the more he reflected, the more convinced he was
that this country was “the most elevated in the world, and the nearest to
the sky.” Where else could this majestic river, that rushed eagerly to this
mighty struggle with the sea, come from, but from that loftiest peak of the
globe, in the midst whereof was the inexhaustible fountain of the four great
rivers of the earth? The faith or the fanaticism&mdash;whichever one may
please to call it&mdash;of the devout cosmographer was never for an instant
shadowed by a doubt. The human learning of all time had taught him
that the shorter way to India must be across that western ocean which, he
was persuaded, covered only one third of the globe and separated the
western coast of Europe from the eastern coast of Asia. When it was
taken for granted that his first voyage had proved this geographical theory
to be the true one, then he could only understand that as in each successive
voyage he had gone farther, so he was only getting nearer and nearer
to the heart of the empire of the Great Khan.</p>

<p>But to the aid of human knowledge came a higher faith; he was
divinely led. In writing of this third voyage to Dona Juana de la Torres,
a lady of the Court and a companion to the Queen, he said: “God made
me the messenger of the new heaven and the new earth of which he spoke
in the Apocalypse by Saint John, after having spoken of it by the mouth
of Isaiah; and he showed me the spot where to find it.”<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>. The end of the
world he believed was at hand; by which he meant, perhaps, only the
world of heathenism and unbelief. In his letter to the sovereigns he said
that “it was clearly predicted concerning these lands by the mouth of the
prophet Isaiah in many places in Scripture, that from Spain the holy name
of God was to be spread abroad.” Amazing and even fantastic as his conclusions
were when they came from the religious side of his nature, they
were to him irrefragable, because they were so severely logical. He was
the chosen instrument of the divine purpose, because it was to him that
the way had been made straight and plain to the glorious East, where God
had planted in the beginning the earthly Paradise, in which he had placed
man, where man had first sinned, and where ere long was to break the
promised dawn of the new heaven and the new earth.</p>

<p>The northern continent of the New World was discovered by the Cabots
a year before the southern mainland was reached by Columbus. Possibly
this northern voyage may have suggested to the geographers of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a new theory, as yet, so far as we know, not thought of in Spain and Portugal,&mdash;that
a hemisphere was to be circumnavigated, and a passage found
among thousands of leagues of islands, or else through some great continent
hitherto unknown,&mdash;except to a few forgotten Northmen of five
hundred years earlier,&mdash;before India could be reached by sailing westward.
In speaking of this voyage long afterward, Sebastian Cabot said: “I began
to saile toward the northwest, not thinking to find any other land than that
of Cathay, and from thence turne toward India; but after certaine dayes
I found that the land ranne towards the North, which was to mee a great
displeasure.”<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> This may have been the afterthought of his old age, when
the belief that the new Indies were the outlying boundaries of the old was
generally discarded. He had forgotten, as the same narrative shows,&mdash;unless
the year be a misprint,&mdash;the exact date of that voyage, saying that
it “was, as farre as I remember, in the yeare 1496, in the beginning of
Summer.” This was a year too soon. But if the statement be accepted as
literally true that he was disappointed in finding, not Cathay and India,
as he had hoped, but another land, then not only the honor of the discovery
of the western continent belongs to his father and to him,&mdash;or
rather to the father alone, for the son was still a boy,&mdash;but the further
distinction of knowing what they had discovered; while Columbus never
awoke from the delusion that he had touched the confines of India.</p>

<p>A discussion of the several interesting questions relating to the voyages
of the Cabots belongs to another chapter;<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> but assuming here that the
voyage of the “Mathew” from Bristol, England, in the summer of 1497,
is beyond controversy, the precedence of the Cabots over Columbus in the
discovery of the continent may be taken for granted. There is other
ample evidence besides his curious letters to show that the latter was on
the coast of South America in the summer of 1498, just thirteen months
and one week after the Cabots made the <i>terra primum visa</i>, whether on the
coast of Nova Scotia, Labrador, or possibly Newfoundland.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Not that this
detracts in any degree, however slight, from the great name of Columbus
as the discoverer of the New World. Of him Sebastian Cabot was mindful
to say, in conversation with the Pope’s envoy in Spain,&mdash;just quoted from
in the preceding paragraph,&mdash;that “when newes were brought that Don
Christopher Colonus, Genoese, had discovered the coasts of India, whereof
was great talke in all the Court of King Henry the 7, who then raigned,
insomuch that all men with great admiration affirmed it to be a thing more
divine than humane to saile by the West into the Easte, where spices
growe, by a map that was never knowen before,&mdash;by this fame and report
there increased in my heart a great flame of desire to attempt some notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
thing.” However notable the thing might be, it could be only secondary
to that achievement of Columbus which Cabot looked upon as “more divine
than human;” but whether in the first sight of the mainland which all
hoped to find beyond the islands already visited, Vespucci did not take
precedence both of the Cabots and of Columbus, has been a disputed
question for nearly four hundred years; and it will probably never be
considered as satisfactorily settled, should it continue in dispute for four
hundred years longer.</p>

<p>The question is, whether Vespucci made four voyages to that half of the
world which was ever after to bear his name,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and whether those voyages
were really made at the time it is said they were. The most essential point,
however, is that of the date of the first voyage: for if that which is
asserted to be the true date be correct, the first discoverer of the western
continent was neither the Cabots nor Columbus, but Vespucci; and his
name was properly enough bestowed upon it. “In the year 1497,” says an
ancient and authentic Bristol manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> “the 24th June, on St. John’s
day, was Newfoundland found by Bristol men [the Cabots] in a ship called
the ‘Mathew.’” On his third voyage, in 1498, Columbus says: “We saw
land [Trinidad] at noon of Tuesday the 31st of July.” In a letter, written
no doubt by Vespucci, he says: “We sailed from the port of Cadiz on
the 10th of May, 1497;”<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> and after leaving the Canaries, where the four
ships of the expedition remained a few days to take in their final supplies
of wood, water, and provisions, they came, he continues, “at the end of
twenty-seven days, upon a coast which we thought to be that of a continent.”
Of these dates the first two mentioned are unquestionably
authentic. If that last given were equally so, there would be an end of all
controversy upon the subject; for it would prove that Vespucci’s discovery
of the continent preceded that of the Cabots, though only by a week
or two, while it must have been earlier than that of Columbus by about
fourteen months.</p>

<p>It should first of all be noted that the sole authority for a voyage made
by Vespucci in 1497 is Vespucci himself. All contemporary history, other
than his own letter, is absolutely silent in regard to such a voyage, whether
it be history in printed books, or in the archives of those kingdoms of
Europe where the precious documents touching the earlier expeditions
to the New World were deposited. Santarem, in his <i>Researches</i>, goes even
farther than this; for he declares that even the name of Vespucci is not
to be found in the Royal Archives of Portugal, covering the period from
1495 to 1503, and including more than a hundred thousand documents
relating to voyages of discovery; that he is not mentioned in the Diplomatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Records of Portugal, which treat of the relations of that kingdom
with Spain and Italy, when one of the duties of ambassadors was to keep
their Governments advised of all new discoveries; and that among the
many valuable manuscripts belonging to the Royal Library at Paris, he,
M. Santarem, sought in vain for any allusion to Vespucci. But these
assertions have little influence over those who do not agree with Santarem
that Vespucci was an impostor. The evidence is overwhelming that he
belonged to some of the expeditions sent out at that period to the southwest;
and if he was so obscure as not to be recognized in any contemporary
notices of those voyages, then it could be maintained with some
plausibility that he might have made an earlier voyage about which nothing
was known. And this would seem the more probable when it was
remembered that the time (1497) of this alleged expedition was within that
interval when “the very tailors,” as Columbus said, might go, without let
or hindrance, in search of riches and renown in the new-found world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the fact of the obscurity of Vespucci at that period is not
without great weight, though Santarem fails in his attempt to prove too
much by it. Columbus believed when, on his second voyage, he coasted
the southern shore of Cuba, that he had touched the continent of Asia. The
extension of that continent he supposed, from indications given by the natives,
and accepted by him as confirming a foregone conclusion, would be found
farther south; and for that reason he took that course on his third voyage.
“The land where the spices grow” was now the aim of all Spanish energy
and enterprise; and it is not likely that this theory of the Admiral was not
well understood among the merchants and navigators who took an intelligent
as well as an intense interest in all that he had done and in all that he
said.</p>

<p>Is it probable, then, that nobody should know of the sailing of four
ships from Cadiz for farther and more important discoveries in the direction
pointed out by Columbus? Or, if their departure was secret, can
there be a rational doubt that the return, with intelligence so important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and generally interesting, would have been talked about in all the ports

<p>But as no account of the voyage appeared till years afterward, and then
in a letter from Vespucci himself; and as, meanwhile, for most of those
years the absence of his name from contemporary records shows that no
celebrity whatever was attached
to it,&mdash;the logical conclusion
is, not only that the voyage
was unknown, but that it was
unknown because it was never
made. Moreover, if it was ever
made it could not have been
unknown, if we may trust Vespucci’s
own statement. For
in his letter&mdash;not written till
1504, and not published in full
till 1507&mdash;he said that this
expedition was sent out by
order of King Ferdinand; that
he, Vespucci, went upon it by
royal command; and that after
his return he made a report of
it to the King. The expedition,
therefore, was clearly not
one of those which, in the interval
between the summers of
1495 and 1497, so often referred
to, escaped all public
record; and as there cannot
be found any recognition of
such an enterprise at that date either in contemporaneous history or State
documents, what other conclusion can be accepted as rational and without
prejudice, than that no such voyage so commanded was made at that time?</p>

</div></div>

<p>There seems to be no escape from this evidence, though it is so purely
negative and circumstantial. But Humboldt, relying upon the researches
of the Spanish historian Muñoz, and upon those gathered by Navarrete
in his <i>Coleccion de los viages y descubrimientos</i>, presents the proof of an <i>alibi</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
for Vespucci. As has been already said on a previous page, the fact is
unquestioned that Vespucci, who had been a resident of Spain for some
time, became in 1495 a member of the commercial house of Juanoto
Berardi, at Seville, and that in January of the next year, as the public
accounts show, he was paid a sum of money relative to a contract with
Government which Berardi did not live to complete. The presumption is
that he would not soon absent himself from his post of duty, where new
and onerous responsibilities had been imposed upon him by the recent
death of the senior partner of the house with which he was connected.
But at any rate he is found there in the spring of 1497, Muñoz having
ascertained that fact from the official records of expenses incurred in fitting
out the ships for western expeditions, still preserved at Seville. Those
records show that from the middle of April, 1497, to the end of May, 1498,
Vespucci was busily engaged at Seville and San Lucar in the equipment of
the fleet with which Columbus sailed on his third voyage. The <i>alibi</i>, therefore,
is complete. Vespucci could not have been absent from Spain from
May, 1497, to October, 1498,&mdash;the period of his alleged first voyage.</p>

<p>All this seems incontrovertible, and should be accepted as conclusive till
fresh researches among the archives of that age shall show, if that be possible,
that those hitherto made have been either misunderstood or are
incomplete. Assuming the negative to be proved, then, as to the alleged
date of Vespucci’s first voyage, the positive evidence, on the other hand, is
ample and unquestioned, that Columbus sailed from San Lucar on his third
voyage on the 30th of May, 1498, and two months later reached the western
continent about the Gulf of Paria.</p>

<p>Was Vespucci then a charlatan? Was he guilty of acts so base as a
falsification of dates, and narratives of pretended voyages, that he might
secure for himself the fame that belonged to another,&mdash;that other, moreover,
being his friend? There are reasons for believing this to be quite true
of him; and other reasons for not believing it at all. There is not, to begin
with, a scrap of original manuscript of his bearing on this point known to
exist; it is not even positively known in what tongue his letters were
written; and anything, therefore, like absolute proof as to what he said
he did or did not do, is clearly impossible. The case has to be tried upon
circumstantial evidence and as one of moral probabilities; and the verdict
must needs differ according to the varying intelligence and disposition of
different juries.</p>

<p>He made, or he claimed to have made,&mdash;assuming the letters attributed
to him to be his,&mdash;four voyages, of each of which he wrote a narrative.
According to the dates given in these letters, he twice sailed from Spain by
order of Ferdinand,&mdash;in May, 1497, and in May, 1499; and twice from Portugal,
in the service of King Emanuel,&mdash;in May, 1501, and in May, 1503.
He was absent, as we learn from the same letters, about seventeen months
on the first voyage, about sixteen each on the second and third, and on the
fourth eleven months. If he went to sea, then, for the first time in May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
1497, and the last voyage ended, as the narrative says, in June, 1504, the
whole period of his seafaring life was eighty-four months, of which sixty
were passed at sea, and twenty-four, at reasonable intervals, on shore. As
the dates of departure and of return are carefully given, obviously the
period from May, 1497, to June, 1504, must be allowed for the four expeditions.
But here we come upon an insurmountable obstacle. If to the
first voyage of 1497 the wrong date was given,&mdash;if, that is, the actual first
voyage was that of 1499, which Vespucci calls his second,&mdash;then he could
not have gone upon four expeditions. From May, 1499, to June, 1504, is
a period of sixty months; and as the aggregate length he gives to the
assumed four voyages is sixty months, they could not have been made in
that time, as that would have compelled him to be at sea the whole five
years, with no interval of return to Spain or Portugal to refit,&mdash;which is
manifestly absurd.</p>

<p>The solution of the difficulty relied upon by Humboldt and others
seems, therefore, insufficient; it is not explained by assuming that the date
1497 in the narrative of the first voyage was the careless blunder of the
translator, copyist, or printer of Vespucci’s original letter. It is not an
error if there were four voyages; for as the date of the last one is undisputed,
the date of 1497 for the first one must remain to give time enough
for the whole. But that there were four voyages does not depend solely
upon the date given to the first one. That there were four&mdash;“quatuor
navigationes”&mdash;is asserted repeatedly by Vespucci in the different letters.
In the relation of the first one, wherein is given this troublesome date which
has so vexed the souls of scholars, he says at some length that as he had
seen on these “twice two” voyages so many strange things, differing so
much from the manners and customs of his own country, he had written a
little book, not yet published, to be called “Four Expeditions, or Four
Voyages,” in which he had related, to the best of his ability, about all he
had seen.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> If, then, the date 1497 is to be explained away as the result
of carelessness or accident,&mdash;even admitting that such an explanation
would explain,&mdash;what is to be done with this passage? It cannot, like a
single numeral&mdash;a 7 for a 9&mdash;be attributed to chance; and it becomes
necessary, therefore, to regard it as an interpolation contrived to sustain
a clumsy falsification of date.</p>

<p>It has also been conjectured that two of the letters have been misapprehended;
that Vespucci meant one as only a continuation of the other in
a description of a single voyage, or if intended as two letters, they were
meant to describe the same voyage. The early editors, it has been suggested,
supposing that each letter described a separate voyage, forged or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
changed the dates in accordance with that supposition. If there were no
other objection to this theory, it is untenable if what has just been said be
true. The duration of each voyage, the aggregate length of the whole, and
the distinct and careful assertion that there were four of them, require that
there should be one prior to that which Vespucci calls his second.</p>

<p>All this leads, according to our present knowledge of the facts, inevitably
to this conclusion,&mdash;whether Vespucci himself wrote, or others wrote
for him, these letters, their very consistency of dates and of circumstantial
assertion show them to have been deliberately composed to establish a
falsehood. For the researches of Muñoz and of Navarrete, as is said above,
prove that Vespucci could not have sailed from Spain on his first voyage
on the 10th or 20th of May, 1497; for from the middle of April of that
year to the end of May, 1498, he was busily employed at Seville and San
Lucar in fitting out the fleet for the third expedition of Columbus.</p>

<p>There is other evidence, negative indeed, but hardly less conclusive, that
this assumed voyage of 1497 was never made. In 1512 Don Diego Columbus
brought an action against the Crown of Spain to recover, as the heir
of his father, Christopher Columbus, the government and a portion of the
revenues of certain provinces on the continent of America. The defence
was that those countries were not discovered by Columbus, and the claim,
therefore, was not valid. It is not to be supposed that the Crown was
negligent in the search for testimony to sustain its own cause, for nearly a
hundred witnesses were examined. But no evidence was offered to prove
that Vespucci&mdash;whose nephew was present at the trial&mdash;visited in 1497
the Terra Firma which the plaintiff maintained his father discovered in
1498. On the other hand, Alonzo de Ojeda, an eminent navigator, declared
that he was sent on an expedition in 1499 to the coast of Paria next after
it was discovered by the Admiral (Columbus); and that “in this voyage
which this said witness made, he took with him Juan de la Cosa and Morigo
Vespuche [Amerigo Vespucci] and other pilots.”<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> When asked how he
knew that Columbus had made the discovery at the time named, his reply
was that he knew it because the Bishop Fonseca had supplied him with that
map which the Admiral had sent home in his letter to the King and Queen.
The act of the Bishop was a dishonorable one, and intended as an injury to
Columbus; and to this purpose Ojeda further lent himself by stopping at
Hispaniola on the return from his voyage, and by exciting there a revolt
against the authority of the Admiral in that island. Perhaps the bitter
animosity of those years had been buried in the grave of the great navigator,
together with the chains which had hung always in his chamber as
a memento of the royal ingratitude; but even in that case it is not likely
that Ojeda would have lost such an opportunity to justify, in some degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
his own conduct by declaring, if he knew it to be so, that Columbus was
not the first discoverer of the continent. It is of course possible, but it is
certainly not probable, that he should not have heard from Vespucci that
this was his second visit to the Gulf of Paria, if that were the fact, and that
his first visit was a year before that of Columbus, whose chart Ojeda was
using to direct his course through seas with which Vespucci was familiar.
This reasonable reflection is dwelt upon by Humboldt, Irving, and others;
and it comes with peculiar force to the careful reader of the letters of
Vespucci, for he was never in the least inclined to hide his light under a
bushel.</p>

<p>The originals of the letters, as has already been said, are not, so far as
is known, in existence; it is even uncertain whether they were written in
Latin, Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese. Nor has the book which Vespucci
said he had prepared&mdash;“The Four Voyages”&mdash;ever been found; but
Humboldt believed that the collected narrative first published at St.-Dié in
1507, in the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i> of Hylacomylus, was made up of extracts
from that book. This St.-Dié edition was in Latin, translated, the
editor says, from the French.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> There is in the British Museum a rare work
of four pages, published also in 1507, the author of which was Walter Lud.
This Lud was the secretary of the Duke of Lorraine, a canon of the St.-Dié
Cathedral, and the founder of the school or college, where he had set
up a printing-press on which was printed the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i>.
From this little book it is learned that the Vespucci letters were sent from
Portugal to the Duke of Lorraine in French, and that they were translated
into Latin by another canon of the St.-Dié Cathedral, one Jean Basin de
Sandacourt, at the request of Lud.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>Vespucci’s last two voyages were made, so his letters assert, in the service
of the King of Portugal. The narrative of the first of these&mdash;the
third of the four voyages&mdash;appeared at different times, at several places,
and were addressed to more than one person, prior to the publication of
the St.-Dié edition of all the letters addressed to René II., the Duke of Lorraine.
This fact has added to the confusion and doubt; for each of these
copies sent to different persons was a translation, presumably from some
common original. One copy of them was addressed to Pietro Soderini,
Gonfaloniere of Florence, whom Vespucci claimed as an old friend and
school-fellow under the instruction of his uncle, Giorgi Antonio Vespucci;
another was sent to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de’ Medici,&mdash;Vespucci’s early
employer,&mdash;both appearing prior to that addressed in the collected edition
of St.-Dié addressed to the Duke of Lorraine. Of the earlier editions
there was one published, according to Humboldt, in Latin, in 1504, at Augsburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and also at Paris; another in German, in 1505, at Strasburg, and
in 1506 at Leipsic; and still another in Italian at Vicenza, in the collection
called <i>Paesi novamente</i>, simultaneously with the St.-Dié edition of 1507.
These in later years were followed by a number of other editions. While
they agree as to general statement, they differ in many particulars, and
especially in regard to dates. These, however, are often mere typographical
blunders or errors of copyists, not unusual at that era, and always
fruitful of controversy. But upon one point, it is to be observed, there is
no difference among them; the voyage of 1501&mdash;the first from Portugal&mdash;is
always the third of the four voyages of Vespucci. This disposes, as
Humboldt points out, of the charge that Vespucci waited till after the death
of Columbus, in 1506, before he ventured to assert publicly that he had
made two voyages by order of the King of Spain prior to entering the
service of the King of Portugal.</p>

<p>To induce him to leave Spain and come to Portugal, Vespucci says, in
the letter addressed to Pietro Soderini, that the King sent to him one
Giuliano Bartholomeo del Giocondo, then a resident of Lisbon. Jocundus
(the latinized pseudonym of Giocondo) is named as the translator of the
Augsburg edition of 1504, addressed to Lorenzo de’ Medici. This Jocundus,
Humboldt thinks, was Giuliano Giocondo. But Major, in his <i>Henry the
Navigator</i>, says that the translation was made, not by Giuliano Giocondo,
but by his kinsman Giovanni Giocondo, of Verona. His authority for
this statement is apparently Walter Lud’s <i>Speculum</i>. Varnhagen thinks it
possible that the work may have been done by one Mathias Ringman,&mdash;of
whom more presently. Varnhagen says also, in another place, that the
translator of the Italian version&mdash;published in the <i>Paesi novamente</i> at
Vicenza in 1507&mdash;unwittingly betrayed that he lied (<i>son mensonge</i>) when
he said that he followed a Spanish copy; for while he failed to comprehend
the use of the word Jocundus, he showed that it was before him in the
Latin copy, as he rendered <i>Jocundus interpres</i>&mdash;Jocundus the translator&mdash;as
<i>el iocondo interprete</i>, the agreeable translator. This is only one example
of the confusion in which the subject is involved.</p>

<p>It was due, however, to the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i> of St.-Dié, in which
the letters appeared as a sort of appendix, that the name of America,
from Amerigo, was given to the western hemisphere. But how it happened
that the <i>Quatuor navigationes</i> should have been first published in
that little town in the Vosges mountains; and what the relation was between
Vespucci and René II., the Duke of Lorraine,&mdash;are among the perplexing
questions in regard to the letters that have been discussed at great length.
Major finds in the fact, or assumed fact, that Fra Giovanno Giocondo was
the translator of the narrative of the third voyage, the first published, in
1504, an important link in the chain of evidence by which he explains the
St.-Dié puzzle. This Giocondo was about that time at Paris as the architect
of the bridge of Notre Dame. A young student, Mathias Ringman, from
Alsace, was also there at that period; and Major supposes he may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
become acquainted with Giocondo, who inspired him with great admiration
for Vespucci. It is certain, at any rate, that Ringman, whose literary
pseudonym was Philesius Vogesina,&mdash;that is, Philesius of the Vosges,&mdash;on
his return to his native province edited the Strasburg edition (1505) of
Giocondo’s translation, appending to it some verses written by himself in
praise of Vespucci and his achievements.</p>

<p>In the rare book already referred to, the <i>Speculum</i> of Walter Lud, it
is said of this Strasburg edition that “the booksellers carry about a certain
epigram of our Philesius in a little book of Vespucci’s translated from
Italian into Latin by Giocondo, of Verona, the architect of Venice.” Doubtless
Ringman is here spoken of as “our Philesius,” because he had become
identified with Lud’s college, where he was the professor of Latin. It seems
almost certain, therefore, that the interest at St.-Dié in Vespucci’s voyages
was inspired by Ringman, whether his enthusiasm was first aroused by his
friendship with Giocondo at Paris, or whether, as Varnhagen supposes, it
was the result of a visit or two to Italy. The latter question is not of much
moment, except as a speculation; and certainly it is not a straining of probabilities
to doubt if Ringman would have taken for his Strasburg edition
of 1505 the Giocondo translation, as Lud says he did, if he had himself
translated, as Varnhagen supposes, the Augsburg edition of 1504.</p>

<p>Lud also asserts in the <i>Speculum</i> that the French copy of the <i>Quatuor
navigationes</i> which was used at St.-Dié came from Portugal. Major supposes
that Ringman’s enthusiasm may have led to correspondence with
Vespucci, who was in Portugal till 1505, and that he caused his letters to be
put into French and sent to Ringman at his request. The narrative of the
third voyage in its several editions must have already given some renown to
Vespucci. Here were other narratives of other voyages by the same navigator.
The clever and enterprising young professors, eager for the dissemination
of knowledge, and not unmindful, possibly, of the credit of their
college, brought out the letters as a part of the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i>
by Hylacomylus&mdash;Martin Waldzeemüller&mdash;the teacher of geography, and
the proof-reader to their new press. Their prince, René II., was known as
a patron of learning; and it is more likely that they should have prefixed
his name to the letters than that Vespucci should have done so. Their
zeal undoubtedly was greater than their knowledge; for had they known
more of the discoveries of the previous fifteen years they would have hesitated
to give to the new continent the name of one who would be thereby
raised thenceforth from comparative, though honorable, obscurity to dishonorable
distinction. That Vespucci himself, however, was responsible
for this there is no positive evidence; and were it not for the difficulty of
explaining his constant insistence of the completion of four voyages, it
might be possible to find some plausible explanation of the confusion of
the St.-Dié book.</p>

<p>In that book are these words: “And the fourth part of the world having
been discovered by Americus, it may be called Amerige; that is, the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Americus or America.”<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> And again: “Now truly, as these regions are more
widely explored, and another fourth part is discovered, by Americus Vesputius,
as may be learned from the following letters, I see no reason why it
should not be justly called Amerigen,&mdash;that is, the land of Americus, or
America, from Americus, its discoverer, a man of acute intellect; inasmuch
as both Europe and Asia have chosen their names from the feminine
form.”<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>It was discovered, less than half a century ago, through the diligent
researches of Humboldt, that this professor of geography at St.-Dié, Hylacomylus,
was thus the inventor, so to speak, of this word America. That it
came at last to be received as the designation of the western continent was
due, perhaps, very much to the absence of any suggestion of any other distinctive
name that seemed appropriate and was generally acceptable. Rare
as the little work, the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i>, now is, it was probably well
known at the time of the publication of its several editions; as the central
position of St.-Dié&mdash;between France, Germany, and Italy&mdash;gave to the
book, as Humboldt thought, a wide circulation, impressing the word America
upon the learned world. The name, however, came very slowly into
use, appearing only occasionally in some book, till in 1522 it gained a more
permanent place on a mappemonde in the <i>Geographia</i> of Ptolemy. From
that time it appeared frequently upon other maps, and by the middle of the
century became generally recognized outside of Spain, at least, as the
established continental name. But the effect of its suggestion was more
immediate upon the fame of Vespucci. While the learned understood that
the great captain of that time was Christopher Columbus, the name of
Amerigo was often united with his as deserving of at least the second
place, and sometimes even of the first. The celebrity which Hylacomylus
bestowed upon him was accepted for performance by those who were
ignorant of the exact truth; and those who knew better did not give
themselves the trouble to correct the error.</p>

<p>In each of Vespucci’s voyages he probably held a subordinate position.
His place may sometimes have been that of a pilot,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> or as the commander
of a single ship, or attached to the fleet, as Herrera<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> says he was in
Ojeda’s expedition (1499), “as merchant, being skilful in cosmography and
navigation.” Vespucci himself does not in so many words assert that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was in command of the expeditions upon which he sailed, while he occasionally
alludes, though usually in terms of contempt, to those whose
authority was above his own. Once he speaks of Columbus, and then
almost parenthetically, as the discoverer merely of the Island of Hispaniola;
but of other of his achievements, or of those of other eminent navigators,
he has nothing to say. In reply to such criticisms of his letters it has been
urged on his behalf that they were written for intimate friends, as familiar
narratives of personal experiences, and not meant to be, in any broad
sense, historical. But the deception was as absolute as if it had been
deliberately contrived; and, whether intentional or not, was never by act or
word corrected, though Vespucci lived for five years after the appearance
of the letters from the St.-Dié press.</p>

<p>But whatever can be or may be said in extenuation of Vespucci, or however
strong the reasons for supposing that for whatever was reprehensible
in the matter he was innocent and the St.-Dié professors alone responsible,
there nevertheless remains the one thing unexplained and inexplicable,&mdash;his
own repeated assertion that he made four voyages. Humboldt supposes
that the narrative of the first, so called, of these four voyages, beginning in
May, 1497, was made up of that on which Vespucci certainly sailed with
Ojeda, starting in May, 1499. The points of resemblance are so many and
so striking as to seem not only conclusive, but to preclude any other theory.
If this be true, then it follows that the narrative of the voyage of 1497 was
simply a forgery, whosoever was responsible for it; and if a forgery, then
Vespucci was not the discoverer of the western continent, and an historical
renown was given to his name to which he was not entitled.</p>

<p>The second of the assumed four voyages Humboldt supposes to be the
first voyage of Vincente Yañez Pinzon,&mdash;hesitating, however, between that
and the voyage of Diego de Lepe: the former sailing with four ships in
December, 1499, and returning in September, 1500; the latter with two ships,
in January, 1500, and returning in June. Vespucci says that he had two
ships; that he sailed in May, 1499, and returned in June or September of
the next year. It is of the first voyage of 1497 that he says he had four
ships. As on that assumed voyage there are many incidents identical with
those related of Ojeda’s voyage of 1499, so here there are strong points
of resemblance between Vespucci’s supposed second voyage and that of
Pinzon. In both cases, however, there are irreconcilable differences,
which Humboldt does not attempt to disguise; while at the same time
they indicate either dishonesty on the part of Vespucci in his letters, or
that those letters were tampered with by others, either ignorantly or with
dishonest intent, to which Vespucci afterward tacitly assented.</p>

<p>It would be hypercritical to insist upon a strict adherence to the dates of
the several voyages, and then to decide that the voyages were impossible
because the dates are irreconcilable. The figures are sometimes obviously
mere blunders; as, for example, the assertion in the St.-Dié edition that the
second voyage was begun in May, 1489, when it had been already said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the first voyage was made in 1497. But there are statements of facts, nevertheless,
which it is necessary to reconcile with dates; and when this is impossible,
a doubt of truthfulness is so far justifiable. Thus in the relation
of the second voyage Vespucci asserts, or is made to assert, that on the
23d of August, 1499, he saw while at sea a conjunction of Mars and the
Moon. That phenomenon did occur at that time, as Humboldt learned
from the Ephemeris; and if it was observed by Vespucci at sea, that could
not have been upon a voyage with Pinzon, who did not sail till (December,
1499) four months after the conjunction of the planets. But here, moreover,
arises another difficulty: Vespucci’s second voyage, in which he observed
this conjunction, could not have been made with Ojeda, and must have been
made with Pinzon, if on other points the narrative be accepted; for it was
upon that voyage that Vespucci says he sailed several degrees south of the
equinoctial line to the mouth of the Amazon,&mdash;which Pinzon did do, and
Ojeda did not. These and other similar discrepancies have led naturally to
the suspicion that the incidents of more than one expedition were used, with
more or less discrimination, but with little regard to chronology, for the
composition of a plausible narrative of two voyages made in the service of
Spain. One blunder, detected by Navarrete in this so-called second voyage,
it is quite incredible that Vespucci could have committed; for according to
the course pursued and the distance sailed, his ships would have been navigated
over nearly three hundred leagues of dry land into the interior of the
continent. No critical temerity is required to see in such a blunder the
carelessness of a copyist or a compositor.</p>

<p>It was of the first voyage from Lisbon&mdash;the third of the <i>Quatuor navigationes</i>&mdash;that,
as has been already said, a narrative was first published in
a letter addressed to Lorenzo de’ Medici. This was illustrated with diagrams
of some of the constellations of the southern hemisphere; and the repute it
gave to the writer led the way to his subsequent fame. What Vespucci’s
position was in the expedition is not known; but that it was still a subordinate
one is evident from his own words, as he speaks of a commander,
though only to find fault with him, and without giving his name. The
object of the expedition was to discover the western passage to the Spice
Islands of the East (Melcha, Melacca, Malaccha, according to the varying
texts of different editions of the letter); and though the passage was not
found, the voyage was, like Cabot’s, one of the boldest and most important
of the age. But it is also, of all Vespucci’s voyages, real or assumed, that
which has been most disputed. Navarrete, however, after a careful examination
of all the evidence that touches the question, comes to the conclusion
that such an expedition, on which Vespucci may have gone in some subordinate
position, was really sent out in 1501 by the King of Portugal; and
Humboldt concurs in this opinion.</p>

<p>The Terra de Vera Cruz, or Brazil, as it was afterward named, was visited
successively for the first time, from January to April, 1500, by Pinzon, De
Lepe, De Mendoza, and Cabral. But the expedition to which Vespucci was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
attached explored the coast from the fifth parallel of southern latitude, three
degrees north of Cape St. Augustin,&mdash;first discovered and so named by
Pinzon,&mdash;as far south, perhaps, as about the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude.
They had sailed along the coast for about seven hundred leagues;
and so beautiful was the country, so luxuriant its vegetation, so salubrious its
climate, where men did not die till they were a hundred and fifty years old,
that Vespucci was persuaded&mdash;as Columbus, only three years before, had
said of the region drained by the Orinoco&mdash;that the earthly Paradise was
not far off. Gold, the natives said, was abundant in the interior; but as the
visitors found none, it was determined at last to continue the voyage in
another direction, leaving behind them this coast, of what seemed to Vespucci
a continent, along which they had sailed from the middle of August
to the middle of February. Starting now on the 15th of February from the
mainland, they steered southeast, till they reached, on the 3d of April, the
fifty-second degree of latitude. They had sailed through stormy seas, driven
by violent gales, running away from daylight into nights of fifteen hours in
length, and encountering a severity of cold unknown in Southern Europe,
and quite beyond their power of endurance. A new land at length was
seen; but it only needed a few hours of observation of its dangerous, rocky,
and ice-bound coast to satisfy them that it was a barren, uninhabited, and
uninhabitable region. This, Varnhagen suggests most reasonably, was the
Island of Georgia, rediscovered by Captain Cook nearly three centuries
afterward.</p>

<p>The return to Lisbon was in September, 1502. By order of the King,
Vespucci sailed again in May, 1503, from Lisbon on a second voyage,&mdash;the
fourth of his <i>Quatuor navigationes</i>. The object, as before, was to find a
western passage to the Moluccas; for it was the trade of India, not new
discoveries in the western continent, upon which the mind of the King was
bent. There were six ships in this new expedition; and it is generally agreed
that as Gonzalo Coelho sailed from Lisbon in May, 1503, by order of Emanuel,
in command of six ships, Vespucci probably held a subordinate position
in that fleet. He does not name Coelho, but he refers to a superior officer as
an obstinate and presumptuous man, who by his bad management wrecked
the flagship. Vespucci may have been put in command of two of the ships
by the King; with two, at any rate, he became separated, in the course of
the voyage, from his commodore, and with them returned to Lisbon in June
of the next year. The rest of the fleet Vespucci reported as lost through
the pride and folly of the commander; and it was thus, he said, that God
punished arrogance. But Vespucci either misunderstood the divine will or
misjudged his commander, for the other ships soon after returned in safety.</p>

<p>The southernmost point reached by him on this voyage was the eighteenth
degree of southern latitude. At this point, somewhere about Cape
Frio, he built a fort, and left in it the crew of one of the two vessels which
had been shipwrecked. The precise spot of this settlement is uncertain; but
as it was planted by Vespucci, and as it was the first colony of Europeans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in that part of the New World, there was an evident and just propriety
in bestowing the derivative&mdash;America&mdash;of his name upon the country,
which at first was known as “The Land of the True Cross,” and afterward
as “Brazil.” The name of Brazil was retained when the wider application&mdash;America&mdash;was
given to the whole continent.</p>

<p>Soon after his return from this, the last of the <i>Navigationes</i> of which he
himself, so far as is known, gave any account, he went back, in 1505, to
Spain. It is conjectured that he made other voyages; but whether he did
or did not, no absolute evidence has ever been found.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> We know almost
nothing of him up to that time except what is told by himself. When he
ceased writing of his own exploits, then also the exploits ceased so far as
can be learned from contemporary authors, who hitherto also had been
silent about him. In 1508 (March 22) Ferdinand of Spain appointed him
pilot-major of the kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>&mdash;an office of dignity and importance, which
probably he retained till he died (Feb. 22, 1512). His fame was largely
posthumous; but a hemisphere is his monument. If not among the greatest
of the world’s great men, he is among the happiest of those on whom good
fortune has bestowed renown.</p>

<p>During recent years (1892-3) John Fiske, in his <i>Discovery of America</i>, vol. ii., has reinforced
the argument of Varnhagen in favor of the disputed (1497) voyage of Vespucius; Henry Harrisse,
in his <i>Discovery of North America</i>, rejects his own earlier arguments in its favor; Clements R.
Markham, in <i>Christopher Columbus</i>, totally discredits the theory, and Justin Winsor, in his <i>Christopher
Columbus</i>, has considered the proposition not proven.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE EDITOR.</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">WHILE Vespucius never once clearly affirms
that he discovered the main, such
an inference may be drawn from what he says.
Peter Martyr gives no date at all for the voyage
of Pinzon and Solis to the Honduras coast,
which was later claimed by Oviedo and Gomara
to have preceded that of Columbus to the main.
Navarrete has pointed out the varied inconsistencies
of the Vespucius narrative,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> as well as
the changes of the dates of the setting out and
the return, as given in the various editions.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
All of them give a period of twenty-nine months
for a voyage which Vespucius says only took
eighteen,&mdash;a difficulty Canovai and others have
tried to get over by changing the date of return
to 1498; and some such change was necessary
to enable Vespucius to be in Spain to start
again with Ojeda in May, 1499. Humboldt
further instances a great variety of obvious
typographical errors in the publications of that
day,&mdash;as, for instance, where Oviedo says Columbus
made his first voyage in 1491.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> But, as
shown in the preceding narrative, an allowance
for errors of the press is not sufficient. In regard
to the proof of an <i>alibi</i> which Humboldt brought
forward from documents said to have been
collected by Muñoz from the archives of the
Casa de la Contratacion, it is unfortunate that
Muñoz himself did not complete that part of
his work which was to pertain to Vespucius,
and that the documents as he collated them have
not been published. In the absence of such
textual demonstration, the inference which Humboldt
drew from Navarrete’s representations of
those documents has been denied by Varnhagen;
and H. H. Bancroft in his <i>Central America</i> (i. 99,
102, 106) does not deem the proof complete.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>Vespucius’ own story for what he calls his
second voyage (1499) is that he sailed from
Cadiz shortly after the middle of May, 1499.
The subsequent dates of his being on the coast
are conflicting; but it would appear that he
reached Spain on his return in June or September,
1500. We have, of course, his narrative of this
voyage in the collective letter to Soderini;<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> but
there is also an independent narrative, published
by Bandini (p. 64) in 1745, said to have been
written July 18, 1500, and printed from a manuscript
preserved in the Riccardiana at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
The testimony of Ojeda that Vespucius was
his companion in the voyage of 1499-1500
seems to need the qualification that he was
with him for a part, and not for the whole, of
the voyage; and it has been advanced that Vespucius
left Ojeda at Hispaniola, and, returning
to Spain, sailed again with Pinzon in December,
1499,&mdash;thus attempting to account for the
combination of events which seem to connect
Vespucius with the voyages of both these
navigators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Oviedo, who sought
to interpret Peter Martyr as showing that Solis
and Pinzon had preceded Columbus to the main,
makes no mention of Vespucius. There is no
mention of him in what Beneventano furnished
to the Ptolemy of 1508. Castanheda does not
allude to him, nor does Barreiros in his <i>De
Ophira regione</i> (Coimbra, 1560), nor Galvano
in his <i>Descobrimientos</i>, nor Pedro Magalhaes de
Gandavo in his account of Santa Cruz (1576).<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>But it was not all forgetfulness as time went
on. The currency to his fame which had been
given by the <i>De orbe antarctica</i>, by the <i>Paesi
novamente</i>, by the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i>, as
well as by the <i>Mundus novus</i> and the publications
which reflected these, was helped on in 1510
by the Roman archæologist Francesco Albertini
in his <i>Opusculum de mirabilibus Urbis Romæ</i>,
who finds Florence, and not Genoa, to have sent
forth the discoverer of the New World.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>Two years later (1512) an edition of Pomponius
Mela which Cocleus edited, probably at
Nuremberg, contained, in a marginal note to a
passage on the “Zona incognita,” the following
words: “Verus Americus Vesputius iam nostro
seculo | novū illū mundū invenissefert Portugalie
Castilieq. regū navibus,” etc. Pighius in 1520
had spoken of the magnitude of the region discovered
by Vespucius, which had gained it the
appellation of a new world.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The references
in Glareanus, Apian, Phrysius, and Münster
show familiarity with his fame by the leading
cosmographical writers of the time. Natale
Conti, in his <i>Universæ historiæ sui temporis libri
XXX</i> (1545-1581), brought him within the
range of his memory.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> In 1590 Myritius, in his
<i>Opusculum geographicum</i>, the last dying flicker, as
it was, of a belief in the Asian connection of the
New World,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> repeats the oft-told story,&mdash;“De
Brasilia, terrâ ignis, de meridionali parte Africæ
ab Alberico Vesputio inventa.”</p>

<p>In the next century the story is still kept up
by the Florentine, Francesco Bocchi, in his
<i>Libri duo elogiorum</i> (1607),<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> and by another
Florentine, Raffael Gualterotti, in a poem,
<i>L’ America</i> (1611),<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>&mdash;not to name many
others.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>But all this fame was not unclouded, and it
failed of reflection in some quarters at least.
The contemporary Portuguese pilots and cosmographers
give no record of Vespucius’ eminence as
a nautical geometrician. The Portuguese annalist
Damião de Goes makes no mention of him.
Neither Peter Martyr nor Benzoni allows him to
have preceded Columbus. Sebastian Cabot, as
early as 1515, questioned if any faith could be
placed in the voyage of 1497 “which Americus
says he made.” It is well known that Las
Casas more than intimated the chance of his
being an impostor; nor do we deduce from
the way that his countrymen, Guicciardini<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> and
Segni, speak of him, that their faith in the prior
claim in his behalf was stable.</p>

<p>An important contestant appeared in Herrera
in 1601,<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> who openly charged Vespucius
with falsifying his dates and changing the date of
1499 to 1497; Herrera probably followed Las
Casas’ manuscripts which he had.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> The allegation
fell in with the prevalent indignation that
somebody, rather than a blind fortune, had deprived
Columbus of the naming of the New
World; and Herrera helped this belief by stating
positively that the voyage of Pinzon and
Solis, which had been depended upon to antedate
Columbus, had taken place as late as
1506.</p>

<p>In the last century Angelo Maria Bandini
attempted to stay this tide of reproach in the
<i>Vita e lettere di Amerigo Vespucci, gentiluomo fiorentino</i>,
which was printed at Florence in 1745.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
It was too manifestly an unbounded panegyric
to enlist the sympathy of scholars. More attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was aroused<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> by an address, with equal
adulation, which Stanislao Canovai delivered to
the Academy at Cortona in 1788, and which was
printed at once as <i>Elogio di Amerigo Vespucci</i>,
and various times afterward, with more or less
change, till it appeared to revive anew the
antagonism of scholars, in 1817.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Muñoz had
promised to disclose the impostures of Vespucius,
but his uncompleted task fell to Santarem,
who found a sympathizer in Navarrete;
and Santarem’s labored depreciation of Vespucius
first appeared in Navarrete’s <i>Coleccion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
where Canovai’s arguments are examined at
length, with studied refutations of some points
hardly worth the labor. This paper was later
expanded, as explained in another place.</p>

<p>He claims that one hundred thousand documents
in the Royal Archives of Portugal, and
the register of maps which belonged to King
Emmanuel, make no mention of Vespucius,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> and
that there is no register of the letters-patent which
Vespucius claimed to have received. Nor is there
any mention in several hundred other contemporary
manuscripts preserved in the great library
at Paris, and in other collections, which Santarem
says he has examined.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>An admirer of Vespucius, and the most
prominent advocate of a belief in the disputed
voyage of 1497, is Francisco Adolpho
de Varnhagen, the Baron de Porto Seguro. As
early as 1839, in notes to his <i>Diario</i> of Lopez de
Souza, he began a long series of publications in
order to counteract the depreciation of Vespucius
by Ayres de Cazal, Navarrete, and Santarem.
In 1854, in his <i>Historia geral do Brazil</i>,
he had combated Humboldt’s opinion that it
was Pinzon with whom Vespucius had sailed
on his second voyage, and had contended for
Ojeda. Varnhagen not only accepts the statements
of the St.-Dié publications regarding that
voyage, but undertakes to track the explorer’s
course. In his <i>Amerigo Vespucci, son caractère</i>,
etc., he gives a map marking the various
voyages of the Florentine.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> For the voyage of
1497 he makes him strike a little south of west
from the Canaries; but leaving his course a
blank from the mid-Atlantic, he resumes it at
Cape Gracias a Dios on the point of Honduras,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
and follows it by the coast thence to the Chesapeake,
when he passes by Bermuda,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> and reaches
Seville. In this he departs from all previous
theories of the landfall, which had placed the
contact on the coast of Paria. He takes a view
of the Ruysch map<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> of 1508 different from that
of any other commentator, in holding the smaller
land terminated with a scroll to be not Cuba,
but a part of the main westerly, visited by
Vespucius in this 1497 voyage; and recently
Harrisse, in his <i>Cortereal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> argues that the descriptions
of Vespucius in this disputed voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
correspond more nearly with the Cantino map<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
than with any other. Harrisse also asks if
Waldseemüller did not have such a map as
Cantino’s before him; and if the map of Vespucius,
which Peter Martyr says Fonseca had,
may not have been the same?</p>

<p>Varnhagen, as might be expected in such an
advocate, turns every undated incident in Vespucius’
favor if he can. He believes that the white-bearded
men who the natives said preceded
the Spaniards were Vespucius and his companions.
A letter of Vianello, dated Dec. 28, 1506,
which Humboldt quotes as mentioning an early
voyage in which La Cosa took part, but hesitates
to assign to any particular year, Varnhagen
eagerly makes applicable to the voyage of 1497.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
The records of the Casa de la Contratacion
which seem to be an impediment to a belief in
the voyage, he makes to have reference, not to
the ships of Columbus, but to those of Vespucius’
own command. Varnhagen’s efforts to elucidate
the career of Vespucius have been eager, if not
in all respects conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p class="p2">We get upon much firmer ground when we
come to the consideration of the voyage of 1501,&mdash;the
first for Portugal, and the third of Vespucius’
so-called four voyages. It seems clear
that this voyage was ordered by the Portuguese
Government to follow up the chance
discovery of the Brazil coast by Cabral in
1500, of which that navigator had sent word
back by a messenger vessel. When the new
exploring fleet sailed is a matter of uncertainty,
for the accounts differ,&mdash;the Dutch edition of
the account putting it as early as May 1, 1501,
while one account places it as late as June 10.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
When the fleet reached the Cape de Verde
Islands, it found there Cabral’s vessels on the
return voyage; and what Vespucius here learned
from Cabral he embodied in a letter, dated
June 4, 1501, which is printed by Baldelli in
his <i>Il Milione di Marco Polo</i>, from a manuscript
preserved in the Riccardiana Collection.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Some
time in August&mdash;for the exact day is in dispute&mdash;he
struck the coast of South America,
and coursed southward,&mdash;returning to Lisbon
Sept. 7, 1502.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>Vespucius now wrote an account of it, addressed
to Lorenzo Piero Francesco de Medici,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
in which he proposed a designation of the new
regions, “novum mundum appellare licet.” Such
is the Latin phraseology, for the original Italian
text is lost.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Within the next two years numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
issues of Giocondo’s Latin text were printed,
only two of which are dated,&mdash;one at Augsburg
in 1504, the other at Strasburg in 1505; and, with
a few exceptions, they all, by their published title,
gave currency to the
designation of <i>Mundus
novus</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest of
these editions is usually
thought to be one
<i>Alberic’ vespucci’ laurētio
petri francisci de
medicis Salutem plurimā
dicit</i>, of which a
fac-simile of the title
is annexed, and which
bears the imprint of
Jehan Lambert.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> It is
a small plaquette of
six leaves; and there
are copies in the Lenox
and Carter-Brown collections.
D’Avezac,
and Harrisse, in his
later opinion (<i>Additions</i>,
p. 19), agree in
supposing this the first
edition. The dated
(1504) Augsburg edition,
<i>Mundus novus</i>, is
called “extraordinarily
rare” by Grenville,
who had a copy, now
in the British Museum.
On the reverse of the
fourth and last leaf we
read: “Magister Johānes
otmar: vindelice
impressit Auguste Anno
millesimo quingentesimo
quarto.” There
are copies in the Lenox
and Carter-Brown libraries.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
An edition,
<i>Mundus novus</i>, whose
four unnumbered
leaves, forty lines to the
full page, correspond wholly with this last issue,
except that for the dated colophon the words
<span class="smcap">Laus Deo</span> are substituted, was put at first by
Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> at the head of the list, with this title.
There is a copy in the Lenox Library, which
has another issue, <i>Mundus novus</i>, also in black-letter,
forty-two lines to the page;<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> still another,
<i>Mundus novus</i>, forty lines to the page;<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
and another, with the words <i>Mundus novus</i> in
Roman, of eight leaves, thirty lines to the page.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
At this point in his enumeration Harrisse placed
originally the Jehan Lambert issue (mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
above), and after it a <i>Mundus novus</i> printed in
Paris by Denys Roce, of which only a fragment
(five leaves) exists, sold in the Libri sale in
London, 1865, and now in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
Another Paris edition,
<i>Mundus novus</i>,
printed by Gilles
de Gourmont, eight
leaves, thirty-one
lines to the page, is,
according to Harrisse,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
known only
in a copy in the
Lenox Library; but
D’Avezac refers to
a copy in the National
Library in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Another <i>Mundus
novus</i> is supposed
by Harrisse to have
been printed somewhere
in the lower
Rhineland, and to
bear the mark of
Wm. Vorsterman,
of Antwerp, on the
last leaf, merely to
give it currency in
the Netherlands. It
has four leaves, and
forty-four lines to
the full page. There
are copies in the
Lenox and Harvard
College libraries.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
The <i>Serapeum</i> for
January, 1861, describes
a <i>Mundus
novus</i> as preserved
in the Mercantile
Library at Hamburg,&mdash;a
plaquette
of four leaves, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
forty-five lines to the page,&mdash;which seems to
differ from all others.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Later, in his <i>Additions</i>
(1872), Harrisse described other issues of the
<i>Novus mundus</i> which do not seem to be identical
with those mentioned in his
<i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>.
One of these&mdash;<i>Mūdus
novus</i>, printed in a very small
gothic letter, four leaves&mdash;he
found in the Biblioteca Cosatenense
at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The other has
for the leading title, <i>Epistola
Albericii: de novo mundo</i>,&mdash;a
plaquette of four leaves, forty-eight
lines to the page, with
map and woodcut.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>This letter of Vespucius was
again issued at Strasburg in
1505, with the title <i>Be [De] ora
antarctica</i>, as shown in the annexed
fac-simile; and joined
with this text, in the little six-leaved
tract, was a letter of Philesius
to Bruno, and some Latin
verses by Philesius; and in this
form we have it probably for
the last time in that language.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
This Philesius we shall encounter
again later.</p>

<p>It was this Latin rendering
by Giocondo, the architect, as
Harrisse thinks,<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> upon which
the Italian text of the <i>Paesi novamente</i>
was founded. Varnhagen
in his <i>Amerigo Vespucci, son
caractère</i> (p. 13), prints side by
side this Italian and the Latin
text, marking different readings
in the latter. In this same
year (1505) the first German
edition was issued at Nuremberg,
though it is undated: <i>Von
der new gefundē Region die wol
ein welt genennt mag werden durch den cristenlichen
Künig von Portugall wunnderbarlich erfunden</i>.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
The colophon shows that this German
version was made from a copy of the Latin text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
brought from Paris in May, 1505: <i>Ausz latein ist
dist missiue in Teütsch gezogē ausz dem exemplar
das von Parisz kam ym maien monet nach Christi
geburt, Funfftzenhundert vnnd Fünffjar. Gedruckt

<p>Another edition, issued the same year (1505),
shows a slight change in the title, <i>Von der neü

<p>Still another edition of the same year and
publisher shows thirty-five lines to the page, and
above the same cut the title reads: <i>Von der neu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>

<p>This is the copy described

(Grenville), which has thirty-five lines to the
page, with the title: <i>Vonderneüw gefunden Region</i>,
etc. It is without date and place; but
Harrisse sets it under 1505, as he does another
issue, <i>Von der Neüwen gefundē Region</i>, of
which he found a copy in the Royal Library at
Munich,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> and still another, <i>Von den Nawen Insulen

<p>In 1506 there were two editions,&mdash;one published
at Strasburg,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> <i>Von den Nüwe Insulē und

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1508 there was, according to Brunet,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> a
Strasburg edition, <i>Von den Neüwen Insulen und
Landen</i>. There was also a Dutch edition, <i>Van
der nieuwer werelt</i>, etc., printed at Antwerp by
Jan van Doesborgh, which was first made known
by Muller, of Amsterdam, through his <i>Books on
America</i> (1872, no. 24). It is a little quarto
tract of eight leaves, without date, printed in
gothic type, thirty and thirty-one lines to the
page, with various woodcuts. It came from an
“insignificant library,”&mdash;that of the architect
Bosschaert,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>&mdash;sold in 1871 in Antwerp, and was
bound up with three other tracts of the first ten
years of the sixteenth century. It cost Muller
830 florins, and subsequently passed into the
Carter-Brown Library, and still remains unique.
Muller had placed it between 1506 and 1509;
but Mr. Bartlett, in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>
(vol. i. no. 38), assigns it to 1508. Muller had
also given a fac-simile of the first page; but only
the cut on that page is reproduced in the <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i> (i. 46), as well as a cut showing
a group of four Indians, which is on the reverse
of the last leaf. Mr. Carter-Brown printed
a fac-simile edition (twenty-five copies) in 1874
for private distribution.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>That portion of the Latin letter which Vespucius
addressed to Soderini on his four voyages
differs from the text connected with Giocondo’s
name, and will be found in the various versions
of the <i>Paesi novamente</i> and in Grynæus, as well
as in Ramusio (i. 128), Bandini (p. 100), and
Canovai in Italian, and in English in Kerr’s <i>Voyages</i>
(vol. iii., 1812, p. 342) and in Lester (p. 223).
There are also German versions in Voss, <i>Allerälteste
Nachricht von den neuen Welt</i> (Berlin,
1722), and in Spanish in Navarrete’s Coleccion
(iii. 190).</p>

<p>There is another text, the “Relazione,” published
by Francesco Bartolozzi in 1789,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> after it
had long remained in manuscript; it also is

<p class="p2">Of the Vespucius-Coelho voyage we have
only the account which is given in connection
with the other three, in which Vespucius gives
May 10 as the date of sailing; but Coelho is
known to have started June 10, with six ships.
Varnhagen has identified the harbor, where he
left the shipwrecked crew, with Port Frio.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
Returning, they reached Lisbon June 18 (or 28),
and on the 4th of the following September Vespucius
dated his account.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p class="p2">If we draw a line from Nancy to Strasburg
as the longer side of a triangle, its apex to the
south will fall among the Vosges, where in a
secluded valley lies the town of St.-Dié. What
we see there to-day of man’s work is scarcely a
century and a half old; for the place was burned
in 1756, and shortly after rebuilt. In the early
part of the sixteenth century St.-Dié was in the
dominion of Duke René of Lorraine. It had its
cathedral and a seminary of learning (under the
patronage of the Duke), and a printing-press had
been set up there. The reigning prince, as an
enlightened friend of erudition, had drawn to his
college a number of learned men; and Pico de
Mirandola, in addressing a letter to the editor
of the Ptolemy of 1513, expressed surprise that
so scholarly a body of men existed in so obscure
a place. Who were these scholars?</p>

<p>The chief agent of the Duke in the matter
seems to have been his secretary, Walter Lud
or Ludd, or Gualterus Ludovicus, as his name
was latinized. The preceding narrative has indicated
his position in this learned community,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
and has cited the little tractate of four leaves by
him, the importance of which was first discovered,
about twenty years ago, by Henry Stevens,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and of which the only copies at present known
are in the British Museum and the Imperial
Library at Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> From this tiny <i>Speculum</i>,
as we shall see, we learn some important particulars.
Just over the line of Lorraine, and
within the limits of Alsace, there was born and
had lived a certain Mathias Ringmann or Ringman.
In these early years of the century (1504)
he was a student in Paris among the pupils of a
certain Dr. John Faber,&mdash;to be in other ways, as
we shall see, connected with the development of
the little story now in progress. In Paris at the
same time, and engaged in building the Notre
Dame bridge, was the Veronese architect Fra
Giovanni Giocondo. Major thinks there is
great reason for believing that the young Alsatian
student formed the acquaintance of the
Italian architect, and was thus brought to entertain
that enthusiasm for Vespucius which Giocondo,
as a countryman of the navigator, seems
to have imparted to his young friend. At least
the little that is known positively seems to indicate
this transmission of admiration.</p>

<p class="p2">We must next revert to what Vespucius
himself was doing to afford material for this
increase of his fame. On his return from his
last voyage he had prepared an account at full
length of his experiences in the New World,
“that coming generations might remember him.”
No such ample document, however, is now
known. There was at this time (1504) living in
Florence a man of fifty-four, Piero Soderini,
who two years before, had been made perpetual
Gonfaloniere of the city. He had been a schoolmate
of Vespucius; and to him, dating from Lisbon,
Sept. 4, 1504, the navigator addressed an
account of what he called his four voyages, abstracted
as is supposed from the larger narrative.
The original text of this abstract is also
missing, unless we believe, with Varnhagen, that
the text which he gives in his <i>Amerigo Vespucci,
son caractère</i>, etc. (p. 34), printed at Lima in
1865, is such, which he supposes to have been
published at Florence in 1505-1506, since a
printed copy of an Italian text, undated, had
been bought by him in Havana (1863) in the
same covers with another tract of 1506.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Other
commentators have not placed this Italian tract
so early. It has not usually been placed before
1510.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Dr. Court put it before 1512. Harrisse
gave it the date of 1516 because he had found it
bound with another tract of that date; but in his
<i>Additions</i>, p. xxv, he acknowledges the reasons
inconclusive. Major contends that there is no
reason to believe that any known Italian text
antedates the Latin, yet to be mentioned. This
Italian text is called <i>Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci
delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi ...
Data in Lisbona a di 4 di Septembre, 1504</i>.
It is a small quarto of sixteen leaves.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Varnhagen does not question that the early
Italian print is the better text, differing as it
does from Bassin’s Latin; and he follows it by
preference in all his arguments. He complains
that Bandini and Canovai reprinted it with many
errors.</p>

<p>Ramusio in his first volume had reprinted
that part of it which covers the third and fourth
voyage; and it had also been given in French in
the collection of Jean Temporal at Lyons in
1556, known otherwise as Jean Leon’s (Leo Africanus)
<i>Historiale description de l’Afrique</i>, with a
preface by Ramusio.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>It is Major’s belief that the original text of
the abstract intended for Soderini was written
in a sort of composite Spanish-Italian dialect,
such as an Italian long in the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the Iberian nations might acquire,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> and that a
copy of it coming into the possession of Vespucius’
countryman, Giocondo, in Paris, it was
by that architect translated into French, and at
Ringmann’s suggestion addressed to René and
intrusted to Ringmann to convey to the Duke, of
whom the Alsatian felt proud, as an enlightened
sovereign whose dominions were within easy
reach of his own home. Major also suggests
that the preliminary parts of the narrative, referring
to the school-day acquaintance of Vespucius
with the person whom he addressed,
while it was true of Soderini,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> was not so of
René; but, being retained, has given rise to confusion.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
Lud tells us only that the letters were
sent from Portugal to René in French, and
Waldseemüller says that they were translated
from the Italian to the French, but without
telling us whence they came.</p>

<p>We know, at all events, that Ringmann returned
to the Vosges country, and was invited
to become professor of Latin in the new college,
where he taught thereafter, and that he
had become known, as was the fashion, under
the Latin name of Philesius, whose verses have
already been referred to. The narrative of
Vespucius, whether Ringmann brought it from
Paris, or however it came, was not turned from
the French into Latin by him,<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> but, as Lud
informs us, by another canon of the Cathedral,
Jean Bassin de Sandacourt, or Johannes Basinus
Sandacurius, as he appears in Lud’s Latin.</p>

<p>Just before this, in 1504, there had joined
the college, as teacher of geography, another
young man who had classicized his name, and
was known as Hylacomylus. It was left, as
has been mentioned, for Humboldt (<i>Examen
critique</i>, iv. 99) to identify him as Martin Waltzemüller,&mdash;who
however preferred to write it
Waldseemüller.</p>

<p>It was a project among this St.-Dié coterie
to edit Ptolemy,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> and illustrate his cosmographical
views, just as another coterie at
Vienna were engaged then and later in studying
the complemental theories of Pomponius
Mela. Waldseemüller, as the teacher of geography,
naturally assumed control of this undertaking;
and the Duke himself so far encouraged
the scheme as to order the engraving of a map
to accompany the exposition of the new discoveries,&mdash;the
same which is now known as the
Admiral’s map.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>In pursuance of these studies Waldseemüller
had prepared a little cosmographical treatise,
and this it was now determined to print at the
College Press at St.-Dié. Nothing could better
accompany it than the Latin translation of the
Four Voyages of Vespucius and some verses by
Philesius; for Ringmann, as we have seen, was
a verse-maker, and had a local fame as a Latin
poet. Accordingly, unless Varnhagen’s theory
is true, which most critics are not inclined to
accept, these letters of Vespucius first got into
print, not in their original Italian, but in a little
Latin quarto of Waldseemüller, printed in this
obscure nook of the Vosges. Under the title of
<i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i>, this appeared twice,
if not oftener, in 1507.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>To establish the sequence of the editions of
the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i> in 1507<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> is a bibliographical
task of some difficulty, and experts
are at variance. D’Avezac (<i>Waltzemüller</i>, p. 112)
makes four editions in 1507, and establishes
a test for distinguishing them by taking the
first line of the title, together with the date of
the colophon; those of May corresponding to the
25th of April, and those of September to the
29th of August:&mdash;</p>

<p>The late Henry C. Murphy<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> maintained that
nos. 1 and 4 in this enumeration are simply
made up from nos. 2 and 3 (the original May
and September editions), to which a new title,&mdash;the
same in each case,&mdash;with the substitution of
other leaves for the originals of leaves 1, 2, 5,
and 6,&mdash;also the same in each case,&mdash;was given.
Harrisse, however, dissents, and thinks D’Avezac’s
no. 1 a genuine first edition. The only
copy of it known<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> was picked up on a Paris quay
for a franc by the geographer Eyriès, which was
sold at his death, in 1846, for 160 francs, and
again at the Nicholas Yéméniz sale (Lyons, no.
2,676), in 1867, for 2,000 francs. It is now in
the Lenox Library.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>Of the second of D’Avezac’s types there
are several copies known. Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> names
the copies in the Lenox, Murphy,<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> and Carter-Brown<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
collections. There is a record of other
copies in the National Library at Rio Janeiro,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
in the Royal Library at Berlin,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> in the Huth
Collection<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> in London, and in the Mazarine
Library in Paris,&mdash;a copy which D’Avezac<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
calls “irréprochable.” Tross held a copy in
1872 for 1,500 francs. Waldseemüller’s name
does not appear in these early May issues,
which are little quartos of fifty-two leaves,
twenty-seven lines to the full page, with an inscription
of twelve lines, in Roman type, on the
back of the folding sheet of a skeleton globe.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>On the 29th of August (iiij kl’ Septembris)
it was reissued, still without Waldseemüller’s
name, of the same size, and fifty-two leaves;
but the folding sheet bears on the reverse an
inscription in fifteen lines. The ordinary title
is D’Avezac’s no. 3. Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> mentions the
Lenox and Carter-Brown<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> copies; but there are
others in Harvard College Library (formerly the
Cooke copy, no. 625, besides an imperfect copy
which belonged to Charles Sumner), in Charles
Deane’s Collection, and in the Barlow Library.
The Murphy Library had a copy (no. 680) in
its catalogue, and the house of John Wiley’s
Sons advertised a copy in New York in 1883
for $350.</p>

<p>There are records of copies in Europe,&mdash;in
the Imperial Library at Vienna, in the National
Library at Paris, and in the Huth Collection
(<i>Catalogue</i>, i. 356) in London. D’Avezac
(<i>Waltzemüller</i>, pp. 54, 55) describes a copy
which belonged to Yéméniz, of Lyons. Brockhaus
advertised one in 1861 (Trömel, no. 1).
Another was sold in Paris for 2,000 francs in
1867. There was another in the Sobolewski
sale (no. 3,769), and one in the Court Catalogue
(no. 92). Leclerc, 1878 (no. 599), has
advertised one for 500 francs, Harrassowitz,
1881, (no. 309) one for 1,000 marks, and Rosenthal,
of Munich, in 1884 (no. 30) held one
at 3,000 marks. One is also shown in the <i>Catalogue
of the Reserved and Most Valuable Portion
of the Libri Collection</i> (no. 15).</p>

<p>The latter portion of the book, embracing
the <i>Quattuor Americi Vesputii navigationes</i>,
seems to have been issued also separately, and
is still occasionally found.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>What seems to have been a composite edition,
corresponding to D’Avezac’s fourth, made up, as
Harrisse thinks (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 47), of the
introductory part of D’Avezac’s first and the
voyages of his third edition, is also found, though
very rarely. There is a copy in the Lenox
Library of this description, and another, described
by Harrisse, in the Mazarine Library in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It was in this precious little quarto of 1507,
whose complicated issues we have endeavored
to trace, that, in the introductory portion, Waldseemüller,
anonymously to the world, but doubtless
with the privity of his fellow-collegians,
proposed in two passages, already quoted, but
here presented in fac-simile, to stand sponsor
for the new-named western world; and with what
result we shall see.</p>

<p>It was a strange sensation to name a new
continent, or even a hitherto unknown part of
an old one. There was again the same uncertainty
of continental lines as when Europe had
been named<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> by the ancients, for there was now
only the vaguest notion of what there was to be
named. Columbus had already died in the belief
that he had only touched the eastern limits
of Asia. There is no good reason to believe that
Vespucius himself was of a different mind.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> So
insignificant a gain to Europe had men come to
believe these new islands, compared with the
regions of wealth and spices with which Vasco
da Gama and Cabral had opened trade by the
African route, that the advocate and deluded
finder of the western route had died obscurely,
with scarcely a record being made of his departure.
A few islands and their savage inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
had scarcely answered the expectation of
those who had pictured from Marco Polo the
golden glories of Cathay.</p>

<p>To Columbus himself the new-found regions
were only “insulæ Indiæ super Gangem,”&mdash;India
east of the Ganges; and the “Indies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>”
which he supposed he had found, and for whose
native races the Asiatic name was borrowed
and continues to abide, remained the Spanish
designation of their possessions therein, though
distinguished in time by the expletive <i>West</i>
Indies.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> It never occurred to the discoverers
themselves to give a new name to regions which
they sometimes designated generically as <i>Mundus
Novus</i> or <i>Alter Orbis</i>; but it is doubtful
as Humboldt says, if they intended by such
designation any further description than that
the parts discovered were newly found, just as
Strabo, Mela, Cadamosto and others had used
similar designations.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> It was at a much later day,
and when the continental character of the New
World was long established, that some Spaniard
suggested <i>Colonia</i>, or <i>Columbiana</i>; and another,
anxious to commemorate the sovereigns
of Castile and Leon, futilely coined the cumbrous
designation of <i>Fer-Isabelica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> When Columbus
and others had followed a long stretch
of the northern coast of South America without
finding a break, and when the volume of water
pouring through the mouths of the Orinoco
betokened to his mind a vast interior, it began
to be suspected that the main coast of Asia had
been found; and the designation of <i>Tierra firme</i>
was naturally attached to the whole region, of
which Paria and the Pearl coast were distinguishable
parts. This designation of Firm Land
was gradually localized as explorations extended,
and covered what later was known as
Castilla del Oro; and began to comprehend in
the time of Purchas,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> for instance, all that extent
of coast from Paria to Costa Rica.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>When Cabral in 1500 sighted the shores of
Brazil, he gave the name of <i>Terra Sanctæ Crucis</i>
to the new-found region,&mdash;the land of the Holy
Cross; and this name continued for some time
to mark as much as was then known of what
we now call South America, and we find it in
such early delineations as the Lenox globe and
the map of Sylvanus in 1511.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> It will be remembered
that in 1502, after what is called his
third voyage, Vespucius had simply named the
same region <i>Mundus Novus</i>.</p>

<p>Thus in 1507 there was no general concurrence
in the designations which had been bestowed
on these new islands and coasts; and
the only unbroken line which had then been
discovered was that stretching from Honduras
well down the eastern coast of South America,
if Vespucius’ statement of having gone to the
thirty-second degree of southern latitude was to
be believed. After the exploration of this coast,&mdash;thanks
to the skill of Vespucius in sounding
his own exploits and giving them an attractive
setting out,<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> aided, probably, by that fortuitous
dispensation of fortune which sometimes awards
fame where it is hardly deserved,&mdash;it had come
to pass that the name of Vespucius had, in common
report, become better associated than that
of Columbus with the magnitude of the new
discoveries. It was not so strange then as it
appears now that the Florentine, rather than
the Genoese, was selected for such continental
commemoration. All this happened to some
degree irrespective of the question of priority
in touching Tierra Firme, as turning upon the
truth or falsity of the date 1497 assigned to
the first of the voyages of Vespucius.</p>

<p>The proposing of a name was easy; the acceptance
of it was not so certain. The little tract
had appeared without any responsible voucher.
The press-mark of St.-Dié was not a powerful
stamp. The community was obscure, and it had
been invested with what influence it possessed
by the association of Duke René with it.</p>

<p>This did not last long. The Duke died in
1508, and his death put a stop to the projected
edition of Ptolemy and broke up the little press;
so that next year (1509), when Waldseemüller
planned a new edition of the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i>,
it was necessary to commit it to Grüninger
in Strasburg to print. In this edition
Waldseemüller first signed his own name to the
preface. Copies of this issue are somewhat less
rare than those of 1507. It is a little tract of
thirty-two leaves, some copies having fourteen,
others fifteen, lines on the back of the folding
sheet.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> The Lenox Library has examples of

<p>The breaking up of the press was
a serious blow to the little community
at St.-Dié. Ringmann, in the full
faith of completing the edition of
Ptolemy which they had in view, had
brought from Italy a Greek manuscript
of the old geographer; but the
poet was soon to follow his patron,
for, having retired to Schlestadt, his
native town, he died there in 1511 at
the early age of twenty-nine. The
Ptolemy project, however, did not
fail. Its production was transferred
to Strasburg; and there, in 1513, it
appeared, including the series of
maps associated ever since with the name of
Hylacomylus, and showing evidences in the text
of the use which had been made of Ringmann’s
Greek manuscript.</p>

<p>We look to this book in vain for any attempt
to follow up the conferring of the name of Vespucius
on the New World. The two maps
which it contains, showing the recent discoveries,
are given in fac-simile on pages 111 and 112. In
one the large region which stands for South
America has no designation; in the other there
is supposed to be some relation to Columbus’
own map, while it bears a legend which gives to
Columbus unequivocally the credit of the discovery
of the New World. It has been contended
of late that the earliest cartographical
application of the name is on two globes preserved
in the collection of the Freiherr von
Hauslab, in Vienna, one of which (printed) Varnhagen
in his paper on Apianus and Schöner puts
under 1509, and the other (manuscript) under
1513. Weiser in his <i>Magalhâes-Strasse</i> (p. 27)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
doubts these dates.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The application of the
new name, America, we also find not far from
this time, say between 1512 and 1515, in a
manuscript mappemonde (see p. 125) which
Major, when he described it in the <i>Archæologia</i>
(xl. p. 1), unhesitatingly ascribed to Leonardo
da Vinci, thinking that he could trace certain
relations between Da Vinci and Vespucius.
This map bears distinctly the name <i>America</i>
on the South American continent. Its connection
with Da Vinci is now denied.</p>

<p>Not far from the same time a certain undated
edition of the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i> appeared
at Lyons, though no place is given. Of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
edition there are two copies in the British Museum,
and others in the Lenox and Barlow collections;
but they all lack a map,<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> which is found
in a copy first brought to public attention by the
bookseller Tross, of Paris, in 1881,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> and which
is now owned by Mr. C. H. Kalbfleisch, of New
York. Its date is uncertain. Harrisse (<i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 63) placed it first in 1510, but
later (<i>Cabots</i>, p. 182) he dated it about 1514, as
Tross had already done. D’Avezac (<i>Waltzemüller</i>,
p. 123) thinks it could not have been
earlier than 1517.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>The chief interest of this map to us is the
fact that it bears the words “America noviter
reperta” on what stands for South America;
and there is fair ground for supposing that it
antedates all other printed maps yet known
which bear this name.</p>

<p>At not far from the same time, fixed in this
instance certainly in 1515, we find <i>America</i> on
the earliest known globe of Schöner.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Probably
printed to accompany this globe, is a rare little
tract, issued the same year (1515) at Nuremberg,
under the title of <i>Luculentissima quædā terræ
totius descriptio</i>. In this Schöner speaks of a
“fourth part of the globe, named after its discoverer,
Americus Vespucius, a man of sagacious
mind, who found it in 1497,” adopting the controverted
date.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the fame of Vespucius was prospering
with the Vienna coterie. One of them,
Georg Tanstetter, sometimes called Collimitius,
was editing the <i>De natura locorum librum</i> of
Albertus Magnus; and apparently after the book
was printed he made with type a marginal note,
to cite the profession of Vespucius that he had
reached to fifty degrees south, as showing that
there was habitable land so far towards the
Southern Pole.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>Joachim Watt, or Vadianus, as he was called
in his editorial Latin, had in 1515 adopted the
new name of America, and repeated it in 1518,
when he reproduced his letter in his edition of
Pomponius Mela, as explained on another page.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
Apian had been employed to make the mappemonde
for it, which was to show the new discoveries.
The map seems not to have been finished
in time; but when it appeared, two years later
(1520), in the new edition of Solinus, by Camers,
though it bore the name of America on
the southern main, it still preserved the legend in
connection therewith which awarded the discovery
to Columbus.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Watt now quarrelled with
Camers, for they had worked jointly, and their
two books are usually found in one cover,
with Apian’s map between them. Returning to
St. Gall, Vadianus practised there as a physician,
and reissued his Mela at Basle in 1522,
dedicating it to that Dr. Faber who had been
the teacher of Ringmann in Paris eighteen years
before.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>In 1522 Lorenz Friess, or Laurentius Phrysius,
another of Duke René’s coterie, a correspondent
of Vespucius, published a new edition
of Ptolemy at the Grüninger press in Strasburg,
in which the fame of Columbus and Vespucius
is kept up in the usual equalizing way.
The preface, by Thomas Ancuparius, sounds the
praises of the Florentine, ascribing to him the
discovery “of what we to-day call America;”
the Admiral’s map, <i>Tabula Terre Nove</i>,<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> which
Waldseemüller had published in the 1513 edition,
is once more reproduced, with other of the
maps of that edition, re-engraved on a reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
scale. The usual legend, crediting the discovery
to Columbus, is shown in a section of the map,
which is given in another place.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Phrysius acknowledges
that the maps are essentially Waldseemüller’s,
though they have some changes and
additions; but he adds a new mappemonde of
his own, putting the name America on the great
southern main,&mdash;the first time of its appearing
in any map of the Ptolemy series. A fac-simile
is annexed.</p>

<p class="p2">There is thus far absolutely no proof that
any one disputed the essential facts of the discovery
by Columbus of the outlying islands of
Asia, as the belief went, or denied him the credit
of giving a new world to the crowns of Aragon
and Castile, whether that were Asia or not.
The maps which have come down to us, so far
as they record anything, invariably give Columbus
the credit. The detractors and panegyrists
of Vespucius have asserted in turn that he was
privy to the doings at St.-Dié and Strasburg,
and that he was not; but proof is lacking for
either proposition. No one can dispute, however,
that he was dead before his name was applied
to the new discoveries on any published
map.</p>

<p>If indeed the date of 1497, as given by the
St.-Dié publication, was correct, there might have
been ground for adjudging his explorations of
the mainland to have antedated those of Columbus;
but the conclusion is irresistible that either
the Spanish authorities did not know that such
a claim had been made, or they deemed the date
an error of the press; since to rely upon the
claim would have helped them in their conflict
with the heirs of Columbus, which began the
year following the publication of that claim, or
in 1508 and continued to vex all concerned till
1527; and during all that time Vespucius, as
has been mentioned, is not named in the
records of the proceedings. It is equally hard
to believe that Ferdinand Columbus would
have passed by a claim derogating from the
fame of his father, if it had come to him as a
positive assertion. That he knew of the St.-Dié
tract we have direct evidence in his possession
of a copy of it. That it did not trouble
him we know also with as much confidence as
negative testimony can impart; for we have no
knowledge of his noticing it, but instead the
positive assertion of a contemporary that he did
not notice it.</p>

<p>The claim for Vespucius, however, was soon
to be set up. In 1527 Las Casas began, if we
may believe Quintana, the writing of his <i>Historia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
It is not easy, however, to fix precisely
the year when he tells us that the belief had
become current of Vespucius being really the
first to set his foot on the main. “Amerigo,” he
tells us further,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> “is said to have placed the name
of America on maps,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> thus sinfully failing toward
the Admiral. If he purposely gave currency to
this belief in his first setting foot on the main, it
was a great wickedness; and if it was not done
intentionally, it looks like it.” Las Casas still
makes allowances, and fails of positive accusation,
when again he speaks of “the injustice
of Amerigo, or the injustice perhaps those who
printed the <i>Quattuor navigationes</i> appear to have
committed toward the Admiral;” and once more
when he says that “foreign writers call the
country America: it ought to be called Columba.”
But he grows more positive as he goes
on, when he wonders how Ferdinand Columbus,
who had, as he says, Vespucius’ account, could
have found nothing in it of deceit and injustice
to object to.</p>

<p>Who were these “foreign writers?” Stobnicza,
of Cracow, in the <i>Introductio in Claudii
Ptholomei cosmographiā</i>, which he published in
1512, said: “Et ne soli Ptolomeo laborassem,
curavi etiam notas facere quasdam partes terre
ipsi ptolomeo alijsque vetustioribus ignotas que
Amerii vespucij aliorumque lustratione ad nostram
noticiam puenere.” Upon the reverse of
folio v., in the chapter “De meridianis,” occurs:
“Similiter in occasu ultra africam &amp; europam
magna pars terre quam ab Americo eius reptore
Americam vocant vulgo autem novus mundus
dicitur.” Upon the reverse of folio vii. in the
chapter “De partibus terre” is this: “Non
solū aūt pdicte tres ptes nunc sunt lacius lustrate,
verum &amp; alia quata pars ab Americo vesputio
sagacis ingenii viro inventa est, quam ab ipso
Americo eius inventore Ameriḡem si a americi
terram sive americā appellari volunt cuius latitudo
est sub tota torrida zona,” etc. These
expressions were repeated in the second edition
in 1519.</p>

<p>Apian in 1524 had accepted the name
in his <i>Cosmographicus liber</i>, as he had in an
uncertain way, in 1522, in two editions, one
printed at Ratisbon, the other without place,
of the tract, <i>Declaratio et usus typi cosmographici</i>,
illustrative of his map.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>Glareanus in 1529 spoke of the land to the
west “quam Americam vocant,” though he
couples the names of Columbus and Vespucius
in speaking of its discovery. Apian and Gemma
Phrysius in their <i>Cosmographia</i> of the same year
recognize the new name;<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> and Phrysius again
in his <i>De principiis astronomiæ</i>, first published
at Antwerp in 1530, gave a chapter (no. xxx.)
to “America,” and repeated it in later editions.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>
Münster in the <i>Novus orbis</i> of 1532
finds that the extended coast of South America
“takes the name of America from Americus,
who discovered it.”<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> We find the name again
in the <i>Epitome trium terræ partium</i> of Vadianus,
published at Tiguri in 1534,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> and in Honter’s
<i>Rudimentorum cosmographiæ libri</i>, published at
Basle in the same year. When the Spanish
sea-manual, Medina’s <i>Arte de navegar</i>, was published
in Italian at Venice in 1544, it had a
chart with America on it; and the <i>De sphæra</i>
of Cornelius Valerius (Antwerp, 1561) says
this fourth part of the world took its name
from Americus.</p>

<p>Thus it was manifest that popular belief, outside
of Spain, at least,<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> was, as Las Casas affirms,
working at last into false channels. Of course
the time would come when Vespucius, wrongfully
or rightfully, would be charged with promoting
this belief. He was already dead, and
could not repel the insinuation. In 1533 this
charge came for the first time in print, so far as
we now know, and from one who had taken his
part in spreading the error. It has already been
mentioned how Schöner, in his globe of 1515,
and in the little book which explained that
globe, had accepted the name from the coterie
of the Vosges. He still used the name in 1520
in another globe.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Now in 1533, in his <i>Opusculum
geographicum ex diversorum libris ac cartis
summa cura &amp; diligentia collectum, accomodatum
ad recenter elaboratum ab eodem globum decriptionis
terrenæ. Ioachimi Camerarii</i>. <i>Ex urbe
Norica, ... Anno XXXIII</i>,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> he unreservedly
charged Vespucius with fixing his own name
upon that region of India Superior which he
believed to be an island.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>In 1535, in a new edition of Ptolemy, Servetus
repeated the map of the New World from
the editions of 1522 and 1525 which helped to
give further currency to the name of America;
but he checks his readers in his text by saying
that those are misled who call the continent
America, since Vespucius never touched it till
long after Columbus had.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> This cautious statement
did not save Servetus from the disdainful
comment of Gomara (1551), who accuses that
editor of Ptolemy of attempting to blacken the
name of the Florentine.</p>

<p>It was but an easy process for a euphonious
name, once accepted for a large part of the new
discoveries, gradually to be extended until it
covered them all. The discovery of the South
Sea by Balboa in 1513 rendered it certain that
there was a country of unmistakably continental
extent lying south of the field of Columbus’
observations, which, though it might prove to be
connected with Asia by the Isthmus of Panama,
was still worthy of an independent designation.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
We have seen how the Land of the Holy Cross,
Paria, and all other names gave way in recognition
of the one man who had best satisfied
Europe that this region had a continental extent.
If it be admitted even that Vespucius was in
any way privy to the bestowal of his name upon
it, there was at first no purpose to enlarge the
application of such name beyond this well-recognized
coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>That the name went beyond
that coast came of one of those shaping tendencies
which are without control. “It was,” as
Humboldt says,<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> “accident, and not fraud and
dissensions, which deprived the continent of
America of the name of Columbus.” It was
in 1541, and by Mercator in his printed gores
for a globe, that in a cartographical record
we first find the name <i>America</i> extended to
cover the entire continent; for he places the
letters AME at Baccalaos, and completed the
name with RICA at the La Plata.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Thus
the injustice was made perpetual; and there
seems no greater instance of the instability
of truth in the world’s history. Such monstrous
perversion could but incite an indignation
which needed a victim,&mdash;and it found him
in Vespucius. The intimation of Schöner was
magnified in time by everybody, and the unfortunate
date of 1497, as well as the altogether
doubtful aspect of his <i>Quattuor navigationes</i>,
helped on the accusation. Vespucius stood in
every cyclopædia and history as the personification
of baseness and arrogance;<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> and his
treacherous return for the kindness which Columbus
did him in February, 1505, when he gave
him a letter of recommendation to his son
Diego,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> at a time when the Florentine stood in
need of such assistance, was often made to point
a moral. The most emphatic of these accusers,
working up his case with every subsidiary help,
has been the Viscount Santarem. He will not
admit the possibility of Vespucius’ ignorance
of the movement at St.-Dié. “We are led to
the conclusion,” he says, in summing up, “that
the name given to the new continent after the
death of Columbus was the result of a preconceived
plan against his memory, either designedly
and with malice aforethought, or by the
secret influence of an extensive patronage of
foreign merchants residing at Seville and elsewhere,
dependent on Vespucius as naval contractor.”<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>It was not till Humboldt approached the
subject in the fourth and fifth volumes of his
<i>Examen critique de l’histoire et de la géographie du
nouveau monde</i> that the great injustice to Vespucius
on account of the greater injustice to
Columbus began to be apparent. No one but
Santarem, since Humboldt’s time, has attempted
to rehabilitate the old arguments. Those who
are cautious had said before that he might
pardonably have given his name to the long
coast-line which he had tracked, but that he was
not responsible for its ultimate expansion.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> But
Humboldt’s opinion at once prevailed, and he reviewed
and confirmed them in his <i>Cosmos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Humboldt’s
views are convincingly and elaborately
enforced; but the busy reader may like to know
they are well epitomized by Wiesener in a paper,
“Améric Vespuce et Christophe Colomb: la véritable
origine du nom d’Amérique,” which was
published in the <i>Revue des questions historiques</i>
(1866), i. 225-252, and translated into English
in the <i>Catholic World</i> (1867), v. 611.</p>

<p>The best English authority on this question
is Mr. R. H. Major, who has examined it
with both thoroughness and condensation of
statement in his paper on the Da Vinci map in
the <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xl., in his <i>Prince Henry
the Navigator</i> (pp. 367-380),<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> and in his <i>Discoveries
of Prince Henry</i>, chap. xiv. Harrisse
in his <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, pp. 65, 94, enumerates
the contestants on the question; and Varnhagen,
who is never unjust to Columbus, traces in a
summary way the progress in the acceptance of
the name of America in his <i>Nouvelles recherches
sur les derniers voyages du navigateur Florentin</i>.
In German, Oscar Peschel in his <i>Geschichte des<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i> (book ii. chap. 13) has
examined the matter with a scholar’s instincts.
The subject was followed by M. Schoetter in a
paper read at the Congrès des Américanistes at
Luxemburg in 1877; but it is not apparent from
the abstract of the paper in the <i>Proceedings</i> of
that session (p. 357) that any new light was
thrown upon the matter.</p>

<p>Professor Jules Marcou would drive the
subject beyond the bounds of any personal
associations by establishing the origin of the
name in the native designation (Americ, Amerrique,
Amerique) of a range of mountains in
Central America;<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> and Mr. T. H. Lambert,
in the <i>Bulletin</i> of the American Geographical

<p class="drop-cap06">OF Pomponius Mela we know little beyond
the fact that he was born in Spain, not far
from Gibraltar, and that he wrote, as seems
probable, his popular geographical treatise in
the year 43 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span><a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> The <i>editio princeps</i> of this
treatise was printed in 1471 at Milan, it is supposed,
by Antonius Zarotus, under the title
<i>Cosmographia</i>. It was a small quarto of fifty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
leaves. Two copies have been sold lately.
The Sunderland copy (no. 10,117) brought
£11 5<i>s.</i>, and has since been held by Quaritch
at £15 15<i>s.</i> Another copy was no. 897 in
part iii. of the <i>Beckford Catalogue</i>. In 1478
there was an edition, <i>De situ orbis</i>, at Venice
(Sunderland, no. 10,118); and in 1482 another
edition, <i>Cosmographia geographica</i>, was also published
at Venice (Leclerc, no. 456; Murphy,
no. 2,003; D’Avezac, <i>Géographes Grecs et Latins</i>,
p. 13). It was called <i>Cosmographia</i> in the edition
of 1498 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 8;
Huth, iv. 1166); <i>De orbis situ</i> in that of Venice,
1502; <i>De totius orbis descriptione</i> in the Paris
edition of 1507, edited by Geofroy Tory (A. J.
Bernard’s <i>Geofroy Tory, premier imprimeur

<p>In 1512 the text of Mela came under new
influences. Henry Stevens (<i>Bibliotheca geographica</i>,
p. 210) and others have pointed out
how a circle of geographical students at this
time were making Vienna a centre of interest
by their interpretation of the views of Mela and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of Solinus, a writer of the third century, whose
<i>Polyhistor</i> is a description of the world known
to the ancients. Within this knot of cosmographers,
John Camers undertook the editing of
Mela; and his edition, <i>De situ orbis</i>, was printed
by Jean Singrein at Vienna in 1512, though it
bears neither place nor date (Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca
geographica</i>, no. 1,825; D’Avezac, <i>Géographes
Grecs et Latins</i>, p. 14; Leclerc, no. 457;
Sunderland, no. 10,119). Another Mela of the
same year (1512) is known to have been printed
by Weissenburger, presumably at Nuremberg,
and edited by Johannes Cocleius as <i>Cosmographia
Pomponii Mele: authoris nitidissimi tribus
libris digesta: ... compendio Johannis Coclei
Norici adaucta quo geographie principia generaliter
comprehēduntur</i> (Weigel, 1877, no. 227;
there is a copy in Charles Deane’s library). In
1517 Mela made a part of the collection of
Antonie Francino at Florence, which was reissued
in 1519 and 1526 (D’Avezac, p. 16; Sunderland,
nos. 10,121, 10,122).</p>

<p>Meanwhile another student, Joachim Watt,
a native of St. Gall, in Switzerland, now about
thirty years old, who had been a student of
Camers, and who is better known by the latinized
form of his name, Vadianus, had, in November,
1514, addressed a letter to Rudolfus
Agricola, in which he adopted the suggestion
first made by Waldseemüller that the forename
of Vespucius should be applied to that part of
the New World which we now call Brazil. This
letter was printed at Vienna (1515) in a little
tract,&mdash;<i>Habes, Lector, hoc libello, Rudolphi Agricolæ
Junioris Rheti ad Jochimum Vadianum epistolam</i>,&mdash;now
become very rare. It contains also
the letter of Agricola, Sept. 1, 1514, which drew
out the response of Vadianus dated October 16,&mdash;Agricola
on his part referring to the work on
Mela which was then occupying Vadianus (a
copy owned by Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca geographica</i>,
no. 2,799, passed into the Huth Library, <i>Catalogue</i>,
v. 1506. Harrassowitz has since priced a
copy, <i>Catalogue</i>, List 61, no. 57, at 280 marks).</p>

<p>The <i>De situ orbis</i> of Mela, as edited by Vadianus,
came out finally in 1518, and contained
one of the two letters,&mdash;that of Vadianus himself;
and it is in this reproduction that writers
have usually referred to its text (Harrisse, <i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 92; Murphy, no. 2,004; Leclerc,
no. 458; Sunderland, no. 10,120; Graesse, v.
401; Carter-Brown, i. 55). Camers also issued
at the same time an edition uniform with the
Aldine imprint of Solinus; and this and the
Mela are often found bound together. Two
years later (1520) copies of the two usually have
bound up between them the famous cordiform
map of Apian (Petrus Apianus, in the Latin
form; Dienewitz, in his vernacular). This for a
long time was considered the earliest engraved
map to show the name of America, which appeared,
as the annexed fac-simile shows, on the
representation of South America. There may
be some question if the map equally belongs to
the Mela and to the Solinus, for the two in this
edition are usually bound together; yet in a few
copies of this double book, as in the Cranmer
copy in the British Museum, and in the Huth
copy (<i>Catalogue</i>, iv. 1372), there is a map for
each book. There are copies of the Solinus
in the Carter-Brown, Lenox, Harvard College,
Boston Public, and American Antiquarian Society
libraries (cf. Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>,
p. 175; <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 108; Murphy, no.
2,338; Trübner, 1876, £15 15s.; Weigel, 1877,
240 marks; Calvary, 1883, 250 marks; Leclerc,
1881, no. 2,686, 500 francs; Ellis &amp; White,
1877, £25). The inscription on the map reads:
“Tipus orbis universalis juxta Ptolomei cosmographi
traditionem et Americi Vespucii aliosque
lustrationes a Petro Apiano Leysnico
elucbrat. An. Do. M.D.XX.” Harrisse (<i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 68) cites from Varnhagen’s
<i>Postface aux trois livraisons sur Vespucci</i>, a
little tract of eight leaves, which is said to be
an exposition of the map to accompany it, called
<i>Declaratio et usus typi cosmographici</i>, Ratisbon,
1522. The map was again used in the first complete
edition of Peter Martyr’s <i>Decades</i>, when
the date was changed to “M.D.XXX” (Carter-Brown,
i. 94; <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 154; Kunstmann,
<i>Entdeckung Amerikas</i>, p. 134; Kohl,
<i>Die beiden ältesten General-Karten von Amerika</i>,
p. 33; Uricoechea, <i>Mapoteca Colombiana</i>, no. 4).
Vadianus meanwhile had quarrelled with Camers,
and had returned to St. Gall, and now
re-edited his <i>Mela</i>, and published it at Basle
in 1522 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 112; Murphy,
no. 2,004**; Carter-Brown, i. 590; Leclerc,
no. 459).</p>

<p>In 1524 Apianus published the first edition
of his cosmographical studies,&mdash;a book that
for near a century, under various revisions, maintained
a high reputation. The <i>Cosmographicus
liber</i> was published at Landshut in 1524,&mdash;a
thin quarto with two diagrams showing the
New World, in one of which the designation is
“Ameri” for an island; in the other, “America.”
Bibliographers differ as to collation, some giving
fifty-two, and others sixty leaves; and there
are evidently different editions of the same year.
The book is usually priced at £5 or £6. Cf.
Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 174; <i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 127, and <i>Additions</i>, p. 87; Carter-Brown,
i. 78; Huth, i. 39; Murphy, no. 93;
Sabin, no. 1,738. There is an account of Apianus
(born 1495; died 1551 or 1552) in Clement’s
<i>Bibliographie curieuse</i> (Göttingen, 1750-1760).
It is in chapter iv. of part ii. of the
<i>Cosmographicus liber</i> that America is mentioned;
but there is no intimation of Columbus
having discovered it. Where “Isabella aut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Cuba” is spoken of, is an early instance of conferring
the latter name on that island, after La
Cosa’s use of it.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">PART OF APIANUS’S MAP, 1520.</p>
         <p class="pf400">There are fac-similes of the entire map in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 69, and in Santarem’s <i>Atlas</i>;
and on a much reduced scale in Daly’s <i>Early Cartography</i>. Cf. Varnhagen’s <i>Jo. Schöner e P. Apianus:

1872, privately printed, 61 pp., 100 copies (<i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, no. 2,231; Quaritch prices it at about £1).
A recent account of the history of the Vienna presses, <i>Wiens Buchdruckergeschichte</i> (1883), by Anton Mayer,
refers to the edition of Solinus of 1520 (vol. i. pp. 38, 41), and to the editions of Pomponius Mela, edited by
Vadianus, giving a fac-simile of the title (p. 39) in one case.</p>

<p class="pf400">Santarem gives twenty-five editions of Ptolemy between 1511 and 1584 which do not bear the name of
America, and three (1522, 1541, and 1552) which have it. Cf. <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie de Paris</i>
(1837), vol. viii.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In 1529 a pupil of Apianus, Gemma Frisius,
annotated his master’s work, when it was published
at Antwerp, while an abridgment, <i>Cosmographiæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
introductio</i>, was printed the same
year (1529) at Ingoldstadt (Sabin, no. 1,739;
Court, no. 21; <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, nos. 148, 149,
and <i>Additions</i>, no. 88. There is a copy of the
abridgment in Harvard College Library).</p>

<p>The third edition of <i>Mela, cum commentariis
Vadiani</i> appeared at Paris in 1530, but without
maps (cf. Carter-Brown, i. 97; Muller, 1877,
no. 2,063; <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 157); and again
in 1532. (Sunderland, no. 10,124; Harrassowitz,
list 61, no. 60).</p>

<p class="p2">It is not necessary to follow, other than synoptically,
the various subsequent editions of
these three representative books, with brief
indications of the changes that they assumed
to comport with the now rapidly advancing
knowledge of the New World.</p>

<p><b>1533.</b> Apianus, full or abridged, in Latin, at
Venice, at Freiburg, at Antwerp, at Ingoldstadt,
at Paris (Carter-Brown, i. 591; <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>,
nos. 179, 202, and <i>Additions</i>, no. 100; Sabin,
nos. 1,742, 1,757. Some copies have 1532 in
the colophon). Apianus printed this year at
Ingoldstadt various tracts in Latin and German
on the instruments used in observations for latitude
and longitude (Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca geographica</i>,
no. 173, etc). Vadianus, in his <i>Epitome
trium terræ partium</i>, published at Tiguri, described
America as a part of Asia (Weigel,
1877, no. 1,574). He dated his preface at St.
Gall, “VII. Kallen. August, M. D. XXXIII.”</p>

<p><b>1534.</b> Apianus in Latin at Venice (<i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet., Additions,</i> no. 106). The <i>Epitome</i>
of Vadianus in folio, published at Tiguri, with
a map, “Typus cosmographicus universalis, Tiguri,
anno <span class="smcap">M. D. XXXIIII</span>,” which resembles
somewhat that of Finæus, representing the New
World as an island approaching the shape
of South America. The Carter-Brown copy
has no map (cf. Huth, v. 1508; Leclerc, no.
586, 130 francs; Carter-Brown, i. 112; Weigel,
1877, no. 1,576; <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 189). An
edition in octavo, without date, is held to be of
the same year. It is usually said to have no
map; but Quaritch (no. 12,475) has advertised
a copy for £4,&mdash;“the only copy he had ever
seen containing the map.” The <i>Huth Catalogue</i>,
v. 1508, shows a copy with twelve woodcut
maps of two leaves each, and four single leaves
of maps and globes. The part pertaining to
America in this edition is pages 544-564,
“Insulæ Oceani præcipuæ,” which is considered
to belong to the Asiatic continent (cf.
Stevens, 1870, no. 2,179; Muller, 1872, no. 1,551;
1877, no. 3,293; Weigel, 1877, no. 1,575).</p>

in Latin, at Antwerp. (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, 209;
Huth, v. 1508; Court, no. 360).</p>

<p><b>1536.</b> An edition of Mela, <i>De situ orbis</i>,
without place and date, was printed at Basle, in
small octavo, with the corrections of Olive and
Barbaro. Cf. D’Avezac, <i>Géographes Grecs et
Latins</i>, p. 20; Sunderland, no. 10,123; Weigel
(1877), p. 99.</p>

<p><b>1537.</b> The first Dutch edition of Apianus,

woodcut of globe on the title. The first of two
small maps shows America. It contains a description
of Peru. Cf. Carter-Brown, i. 121;
Muller (1875), no. 2,314.</p>

<p><b>1538.</b> Mela and Solinus, printed by Henri
Petri at Basle with large and small maps, one
representing the New World to the east of Asia
as “Terra incognita.” Cf. Harrassowitz (1882),
no. 91, p. 2, 60 marks; D’Avezac, p. 21.</p>

<p><b>1539.</b> An edition of Mela, <i>De orbis situ</i>, at
Paris (Sunderland, no. 10,124). Apianus’s <i>Cosmographia
per Gemmam Phrysium restituta</i>, in
small quarto, was published at Antwerp by A.
Berckman. A globe on the titlepage shows the
Old World. It has no other map (Carter-Brown,
i. 124; Sabin, no. 1,744; <i>Bibl. Amer.
Vet.</i>, nos. 229, 230).</p>

<p><b>1540.</b> An edition of Mela, issued at Paris,
has the Orontius Finæus map of 1531, with the
type of the Dedication changed. The Harvard
College copy and one given in Harrassowitz’

<p class="pc mid">THE COMPANIONS OF COLUMBUS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN 1498 the news of the discovery of Paria and the pearl fisheries reached
Spain; and during the next year a number of expeditions was fitted
out at private expense for trade and exploration. The first to set sail was
commanded by Alonso de Ojeda, the quondam captor of Caonabo, who,
with Juan de la Cosa&mdash;a mariner scarcely inferior in his own estimation
to the Admiral himself&mdash;and with Morigo Vespuche, as Ojeda calls him,
left the Bay of Cadiz toward the end of May, 1499. Ojeda, provided
with a copy of the track-chart sent home by Columbus, easily found his
way to the coast of South America, a few degrees north of the equator.
Thence he coasted northward by the mouth of the Rio Dulce (Essequibo)
into the Gulf of Paria, which he left by the Boca del Drago. He then
passed to the Isla Margarita and the northern shores of Tierra Firme,
along which he sailed until he came to a deep gulf into which opened
a large lagoon. The gulf he called the Golfo de Venecia (Venezuela),
from the fancied resemblance of a village on its shores to the Queen of
the Adriatic; while to the lagoon, now known as the Lake of Maracáibo,
he gave the name of S. Bartoloméo. From this gulf he sailed westward
by the land of Coquibacoa to the Cabo de la Vela, whence he took his
departure for home, where, after many adventures, he arrived in the
summer of the following year.</p>

<p>Close in his track sailed Cristóbal Guerra and Pedro Alonso Niño, who
arrived off the coast of Paria a few days after Ojeda had left it. Still
following him, they traded along the coast as far west as Caucheto, and
tarried at the neighboring islands, especially Margarita, until their little
vessel of fifty tons was well loaded; when they sailed for Spain, where they
arrived in April, 1500, “so laden with pearls that they were in maner with
every mariner as common as chaffe.”</p>

<p>About four months before Guerra’s return, Vicente Yañez Pinzon, the
former captain of the “Niña,” sailed from Palos with four vessels; and,
pursuing a southerly course, was the first of Europeans to cross the equator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
on the American side of the Atlantic. He sighted the coast of the New
World in eight degrees south latitude, near a cape to which he gave the
name of Santa Maria de la Consolacion (S. Augustin). There he landed;
but met with no vestiges of human beings, except some footprints of gigantic
size. After taking possession of the country with all proper forms, he
reimbarked; and proceeding northward and westward, discovered and partially
explored the delta of an immense river, which he called the Paricura,
and which, after being known as the Marañon or Orellana, now appears on
the maps as the Amazon. Thence, by the Gulf of Paria, Española (Hispaniola),
and the Bahamas, he returned to Spain, where he arrived in the
latter part of September, 1500.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>Diego de Lepe left Palos not long after Vicente Yañez, and reached the
coast of the New World to the south of the Cabo de S. Augustin, to which
he gave the name of <i>Rostro hermoso</i>; and doubling it, he ran along the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to the Gulf of Paria, whence he returned to Palos. In October, 1500, Rodrigo
de Bastidas and Juan de la Cosa sailed from the bay of Cadiz for the
Golfo de Venecia (Venezuela), which they entered and explored. Thence,
stopping occasionally to trade with the natives, they coasted the shores of
Tierra Firme, by the Cabo de la Vela, the province of Santa Marta, the
mouths of the Rio Grande de la Magdalena, the port of Cartagena, the river
of Cenú, and the Punta Caribana, to the Gulf of Urabá (Darien), which they
explored with some care. They were unsuccessful in their search for a strait
to the west; and after sailing along the coast of Veragua to Nombre de Dios,
they started on the return voyage. But the ravages of the <i>broma</i> (teredo)
rendering their ships leaky, they were forced into a harbor of Española,
where the vessels, after the most valuable portions of the cargo had been
removed, went to the bottom. Bastidas was seized by order of Bobadilla,
then governor of Española, for alleged illicit traffic with the natives, and sent
to Spain for trial, where he arrived in September, 1502. He was soon after
acquitted on the charges brought against him.</p>

<p>Alonso de Ojeda had reported the presence of Englishmen on the coast
of Tierra Firme; and, partly to forestall any occupation of the country by
them, he had been given permission to explore, settle, and govern, at his
own expense, the province of Coquibacoa. He associated with him Juan
de Vergara and Garcia de Ocampo, who provided the funds required, and
went with the expedition which left Cadiz in January, 1502. They reached,
without any serious mishap, the Gulf of Paria, where they beached and
cleaned their vessels, and encountered the natives. Thence through the
Boca del Drago they traded from port to port, until they came to an
irrigated land, which the natives called Curiana, but to which Ojeda gave
the name of Valfermoso. At this place they seized whatever they could
which might be of service in the infant settlement, and then proceeded
westward; while Vergara went to Jamaica for provisions, with orders to
rejoin the fleet at S. Bartoloméo (Maracáibo), or at the Cabo de la Vela.
After visiting the Island of Curazao (Curaçao) Ojeda arrived at Coquibacoa,
and finally decided to settle at a place which he called Santa Cruz,&mdash;probably
the Bahia Honda of the present day. Vergara soon arrived; but the
supply of food was inadequate, and the hostility of the natives made foraging
a matter of great difficulty and danger. To add to their discomfort,
quarrels broke out between the leaders, and Ojeda was seized by his two
partners and carried to Española, where he arrived in September, 1502.
He was eventually set at liberty, while his goods were restored by the King’s
command. The expedition, however, was a complete failure.</p>

<p>This second unprofitable voyage of Ojeda seems to have dampened the
ardor of the navigators and their friends at home; and although Navarrete
regards it as certain that Juan de la Cosa sailed to Urabá as chief in command
in 1504-1506, and that Ojeda made a voyage in the direction of
Tierra Firme in the beginning of 1505, it was not until after the successful
voyage of La Cosa in 1507-1508, that the work of colonization was again
taken up with vigor.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> Two men offered themselves as leaders in this
enterprise; and, as it was impossible to decide between them, they were
both commissioned to settle and govern for four years the mainland from
the Cabo de la Vela to the Cabo Gracias á Dios, while the Gulf of Urabá
(Darien) was to be the boundary between their respective governments.
To Alonso de Ojeda was given the eastern province, or Nueva Andaluçia,
while Diego de Nicuesa was the destined governor of the western province,
then for the first time named Castilla del Oro. The fertile Island of
Jamaica was intended to serve as a granary to the two governors; and to
them were also granted many other privileges,&mdash;as, for instance, freedom
from taxation, and, more important still, the right for each to take from
Española four hundred settlers and two hundred miners.</p>

<p>Nicuesa and Ojeda met at Santo Domingo, whither they had gone to
complete their preparations, and became involved in a boundary dispute.
Each claimed the province of Darien<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> as within his jurisdiction. It was
finally agreed, however, that the river of Darien should be the boundary
line. With regard to Jamaica, the new admiral, Diego Columbus, prevented
all disputes by sending Juan de Esquivel to hold it for him. Diego further
contributed to the failure of the enterprise by preventing the governors
from taking the colonists from Española, to which they were entitled by
their licenses. At last, however, on Nov. 12, 1509, Ojeda, with Juan de la
Cosa and three hundred men, left Santo Domingo; and five days later
entered the harbor of Cartagena, where he landed, and had a disastrous
engagement with the natives. These used their poisoned arrows to such good
purpose that sixty-nine Spaniards, Juan de la Cosa among them, were killed.
Nicuesa arrived in the harbor soon after; and the two commanders, joining
forces, drove the natives back, and recovered the body of La Cosa, which
they found swollen and disfigured by poison, and suspended from a tree.
The two fleets then separated; Nicuesa standing over to the shore of Castilla
del Oro, while Ojeda coasted the western shore of the Gulf of Urabá, and
settled at a place to which he gave the name of San Sebastian. Here they
built a fort, and ravaged the surrounding country in search of gold, slaves,
and food; but here again the natives, who used poisoned arrows, kept the
Spaniards within their fort, where starvation soon stared them in the face.
Ojeda despatched a ship to Española for provisions and recruits; and no
help coming, went himself in a vessel which had been brought to San
Sebastian by a certain piratical Talavera. Ojeda was wrecked on Cuba;
but after terrible suffering reached Santo Domingo, only to find that his
lieutenant, Enciso, had sailed some time before with all that was necessary
for the relief of the colony. The future movements of Ojeda are
not known. He testified in the trial of Talavera and his companions,
who were hanged in 1511; and in 1513 and 1515 his depositions were
taken in the suit brought by the King’s attorney against the heirs of
Columbus. Broken in spirit and ruined in fortune, he never returned to
his colony.</p>

<p>Martin Fernandez de Enciso, a wealthy lawyer (<i>bachiller</i>) of Santo
Domingo, had been appointed by Ojeda <i>alcalde mayor</i> of Nueva Andaluçia,
and had been left behind to follow his chief with stores and recruits. On
his way to San Sebastian he stopped at Cartagena; found no difficulty in
making friends with the natives who had opposed Ojeda so stoutly; and
while awaiting there the completion of some repairs on a boat, was surprised
by the appearance of a brigantine containing the remnant of the San
Sebastian colony. When Ojeda had sailed with Talavera he had left
Pizarro, the future conqueror of Peru, in command, with orders to hold
the place for fifty days, and then, if succor had not arrived, to make the
best of his way to Santo Domingo. Pizarro had waited more than fifty
days, until the colonists had dwindled to a number not too large for the two
little vessels at his disposal. In these they had then left the place. But
soon after clearing the harbor one of his brigantines, struck by a fish, had
gone down with all on board; and it had been with much difficulty that the
other had been navigated to Cartagena. Enciso, commander now that
Ojeda and La Cosa were gone, determined to return to San Sebastian; but,
while rounding the Punta Caribana, the large vessel laden with the stores
went on the rocks and became a total loss, the crew barely escaping with
their lives. They were now in as bad a plight as before; and decided, at
the suggestion of Vasco Nuñez de Balbóa, to cross the Gulf of Urabá to a
country where the natives did not use poisoned arrows, and where, therefore,
foraging would not be so dangerous as at San Sebastian.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> The removal
to the other side of the gulf was safely carried out, and the natives driven
from their village. The Spaniards settled themselves here, and called the
place Santa Maria del Antigua del Darien. Provisions and gold were found
in abundance; but Enciso, declaring it unlawful for private persons to trade
with the natives for gold, was deposed; for, as Vasco Nuñez said, the new
settlement was within the jurisdiction of Nicuesa, and therefore no obedience
whatever was due to Enciso. A municipal form of government was
then instituted, with Vasco Nuñez and Zamudio as <i>alcaldes</i>, and Valdivia
as <i>regidor</i>. But the Antigua settlers were no more disposed to obey their
chosen magistrates than they had been to give obedience to him who had
been appointed to rule over them, and they soon became divided into
factions. At this juncture arrived Rodrigo Enriquez de Colmenares, whom
Nicuesa had left at Española to follow him with recruits and provisions.
Colmenares easily persuaded the settlers at Antigua to put themselves under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the government of Nicuesa; and then, accompanied by two agents from
Darien, sailed away in search of his chief. Nicuesa, after aiding Ojeda at
Cartagena, had sailed for Castilla del Oro; but while coasting its shores had
become separated from the rest of his fleet, and had been wrecked off the
mouth of a large river. He had rejoined the rest of his expedition after the
most terrible suffering. Nicuesa had suspected Lope de Olano, his second
in command, of lukewarmness in going to his relief, and had put him in
chains. In this condition he was found by the agents from Antigua, to one
of whom it appears that Olano was related. This, and the punishment
with which Nicuesa threatened those at Antigua who had traded for gold,
impelled the agents to return with all speed to oppose his reception; and,
therefore, when he arrived off Antigua he was told to go back. Attempting
to sustain himself on land, he was seized, put on a worn-out vessel, and
bid to make the best of his way to Española. He sailed from Antigua in
March, 1511, and was never heard of again.</p>

<p>After his departure the quarrels between the two factions broke out
again, and were appeased only by the sending of Enciso and Zamudio to
Spain to present their respective cases at Court. They sailed for Española
in a vessel commanded by the <i>regidor</i> Valdivia (a firm friend of Vasco
Nuñez), who went well provided with gold to secure the favor and protection
of the new admiral, Diego Columbus, and of Pasamonte, the King’s
treasurer at Santo Domingo, for himself and Vasco Nuñez. While Valdivia
was absent on this mission, Vasco Nuñez explored the surrounding country
and won the good-will of the natives. It was on one of these expeditions
that the son of a chief, seeing the greed of the Spaniards for gold, told them
of the shores of a sea which lay to the southward of the mountains, where
there were kings who possessed enormous quantities of the highly coveted
metal. Valdivia, who brought a commission from the Admiral to Vasco
Nuñez (commonly called Balbóa) as governor of Antigua, was immediately
sent back with a large sum of money, carrying the news of a sea to be discovered.
Valdivia was wrecked on the southern coast of Yucatan, where,
with all but two of his crew, he was sacrificed and eaten by the natives.
After some time had elapsed with no news from Española, Vasco Nuñez,
fearing that Valdivia had proved a treacherous friend, despatched two
emissaries&mdash;Colmenares and Caicedo&mdash;to Spain to lay the state of affairs
at Darien before the King.</p>

<p>Not long after their departure a vessel arrived from Española, commanded
by Serrano, with food, recruits, and a commission from Pasamonte to Vasco
Nuñez as governor. But Serrano also brought a letter from Zamudio, giving
an account of his experience in Spain, where he had found the King more
disposed to consider favorably the complaints of Enciso than the justifications
which he himself offered. Indeed, it seems that Zamudio, who barely
escaped arrest, wrote that it was probable that Vasco Nuñez would be
summoned to Spain to give an account of himself. Upon the receipt of
this unpleasant letter, Vasco Nuñez determined to discover the new sea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
which there was report, and thus to atone for his shortcomings with respect
to Enciso and Nicuesa.</p>

<p>To this end he left Antigua on the 1st of September, 1513; and proceeding
by the way of the country of Careta, on the evening of September 24
encamped on the side of a mountain from whose topmost peak his native
guide declared the other sea could be discerned. Early in the morning
of the next day, Sept. 25, 1513, the sixty-seven Spaniards ascended
the mountain; and Vasco Nuñez de Balbóa, going somewhat in advance,
found himself&mdash;first of civilized men&mdash;gazing upon the new-found sea,
which he called <i>Mar del Sur</i> (South Sea), in distinction to the <i>Mar del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Norte</i>, or the sea on the northern side of the isthmus, although it is known
to us by the name of Pacific, which Magellan later gave to it. Of this ocean
and all lands bordering upon it he took possession for his royal master and
mistress, and then descended toward its shores. The sea itself was hard to
reach, and it was not until three days later that a detachment under Alonso
Martin discovered the beach; when Alonso Martin, jumping into a convenient
canoe, pushed forth, while he called upon his comrades to bear witness
that he was the first European to sail upon the southern sea. On the
29th of September Vasco Nuñez reached the water; and marching boldly
into it, again claimed it for the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon. It
was an arm of the ocean which he had found. According to the Spanish
custom, he bestowed upon it the name of the patron saint of that particular
day, and as the Gulf of San Miguel it is still known to us. After a short
voyage in some canoes, in the course of which Vasco Nuñez came near
drowning, he collected an immense amount of tribute from the neighboring
chiefs, and then took up his homeward march, arriving at Antigua without
serious accident in the latter part of January, 1514. When we consider
the small force at his command and the almost overpowering difficulties
of the route,&mdash;to say nothing of hostile natives,&mdash;this march of Vasco
Nuñez de Balbóa is among the most wonderful exploits of which we have
trustworthy information.</p>

<p>But this achievement did not bring him the indemnity and honors for
which he hoped. A new governor, appointed July 27, 1513,&mdash;notwithstanding
the news which Colmenares and Caicedo had carried with them
of the existence of a sea,&mdash;had sailed before Pedro de Arbolancha, bearing
the news of the discovery, could arrive in Spain, inasmuch as he did not
even leave Antigua until March, 1514. This new governor was Pedro
Arias de Avila, better known as Pedrárias, though sometimes called by
English writers Dávila. Pedrárias, dubbed <i>El Galan</i> and <i>El Justador</i> in his
youth, and <i>Furor Domini</i> in his later years, has been given a hard character
by all historians. This is perfectly natural, for, like all other Spanish governors,
he cruelly oppressed the natives, and thus won the dislike of Las
Casas; while Oviedo, who usually differs as much as possible from Las
Casas, hated Pedrárias for other reasons. Pedrárias’ treatment of Vasco
Nuñez, in whose career there was that dramatic element so captivating, was
scant at least of favor. But, on the other hand, it must be remembered that
Pedrárias occupied an office from which Nicuesa and Enciso had been
driven, and he ruled a community which had required the utmost vigilance
on the part of Vasco Nuñez to hold in check.</p>

<p>With Pedrárias went a goodly company, among whom may be mentioned
Hernando de Soto, Diego de Almagro, and Benalcazar, who, with Pizarro,
already in Antigua, were to push discovery and conquest along the shores
of the Mar del Sur. There also went in the same company that Bernal Diaz
del Castillo who was to be one of the future conquistadores of Mexico and
the rude but charming relater of that conquest; and Pascual de Andagoya,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
who, while inferior to Benalcazar as a ruler and to Bernal Diaz as a narrator,
was yet a very important character. The lawyer Enciso returned among
them to the scene of his former disappointment as <i>alguazil mayor</i>; and,
lastly, let us mention Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés, who accompanied
the expedition as <i>escriban general</i> and <i>veedor.</i> Pedrárias sailed from
San Lucar on the 12th of April, 1514, and arrived safely in the harbor of
Antigua on the 29th of June. The survivors of the companies of Ojeda
and Nicuesa, and of the reinforcements brought thither at different times,
numbered in all but four hundred and fifty souls; and they could have
offered little opposition to the fifteen hundred accompanying Pedrárias,
if they had so desired. But no attempt was made to prevent his landing;
and as soon as Pedrárias felt himself fairly installed, an inquiry was instituted
into the previous acts of Vasco Nuñez. This trial, or <i>residencia</i>, was conducted
by Espinosa, the new <i>alcalde mayor</i>. There is no doubt but that
Enciso tried hard to bring the murder of Nicuesa, for such it was, home to
Vasco Nuñez. The efforts of Quivedo, the recently appointed bishop of
Santa Maria de la Antigua é Castilla del Oro, and of Isabel del Bobadilla,
the new governor’s wife, who had been won over in some unknown way,
secured the acquittal of Vasco Nuñez on all criminal charges. In the innumerable
civil suits, however, which were brought against him by Enciso
and by all others who felt grieved, he was mulcted in a large amount.</p>

<p>This affair off his hands, Pedrárias set about executing his supplementary
instructions, which were to connect the north and south seas by a chain
of posts. He sent out three expeditions, which, besides exploration, were
to forage for food, since the supply in Antigua was very small. The stores
brought by the fleet had been in a great measure spoiled on the voyage,
and the provisions at Antigua which Vasco Nuñez’ foresight had provided,
while ample for his little band, were entirely inadequate to the support of the
augmented colony. The leaders of these expeditions&mdash;with the exception
of Enciso, who went to Cenú, whence he was speedily driven&mdash;acted in a
most inhuman fashion; and the good feeling which had subsisted between
Vasco Nuñez and the natives was changed to the most bitter hatred. To
use Vasco Nuñez’ own words: “For where the Indians were like sheep, they
have become like fierce lions, and have acquired so much daring, that
formerly they were accustomed to come out to the paths with presents
to the Christians, now they come out and they kill them; and this has been
on account of the bad things which the captains who went out on the
incursions have done to them.” He especially blamed Ayora and Morales,
who commanded two of the earliest expeditions. Ayora escaped with his
ill-gotten wealth to Spain, where he died before he could be brought to
justice.</p>

<p>Morales, following the route of Vasco Nuñez across the isthmus, arrived
on the other side, and sailed to the Pearl Islands, which Vasco Nuñez had
seen in the distance. Here he obtained an immense booty; and thence,
crossing to the southern side of the Gulf of San Miguel, he endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to return to Darien by the way of Birú and the River Atrato. But he was
speedily driven back; and was so hard pressed by the natives throughout
his homeward march that he and his companions barely escaped with
their treasure and their lives. It was about this time that Vasco Nuñez
went for a second time in search of the golden temple of Dabaibe and
suffered defeat, with the loss of Luis Carillo, his second in command, and
many of his men; while another attempt on Cenú, this time by Becerra,
ended in the death of that commander and of all but one of his companions.
In 1515, however, a force commanded by Gonzalo de Badajos crossed
the isthmus and discovered the rich country lying on the Gulf of Parita.
Badajos accumulated an enormous amount of gold, which he was obliged
to abandon when he sought safety in ignominious flight.</p>

<p>These repeated disasters in the direction of Cenú nettled old Pedrárias,
and he resolved to go himself in command of an expedition and chastise
the natives. He was speedily defeated; but, instead of returning immediately
to Antigua, he sailed over to Veragua and founded the town of Acla
(Bones of Men), as the northern termination of a road across the isthmus.
He then sent Gaspar Espinosa across the isthmus to found a town on the
other side. Espinosa on his way met the fleeing Badajos; but being better
prepared, and a more able commander, he recovered the abandoned treasure
and founded the old town of Panamá; while a detachment under
Hurtado, which he sent along the coast toward the west, discovered the
Gulf of San Lucar (Nicoya).</p>

<p>As we have seen, Vasco Nuñez’ account of the discovery of the South
Sea reached Spain too late to prevent the sailing of Pedrárias; but the
King nevertheless placed reliance in him, and appointed him <i>adelantado</i>,
or lieutenant, to prosecute discoveries along the shores of the southern sea,
and also made him governor of the provinces of Panamá and Coyba. This
commission had reached Antigua before the departure of Espinosa; but
Pedrárias withheld it for reasons of his own. And before he delivered it
there arrived from Cuba a vessel commanded by a friend of Vasco Nuñez,&mdash;a
certain Garabito,&mdash;who by making known his arrival to Vasco Nuñez and
not to Pedrárias, aroused the latter’s suspicions. Accordingly, Vasco Nuñez
was seized and placed in confinement. After a while, however, upon his
promising to marry one of Pedrárias’ daughters, who at the time was in
Spain, they became reconciled, and Vasco Nuñez was given his commission,
and immediately began preparation for a voyage on the South Sea. As it
seemed impossible to obtain a sufficient amount of the proper kind of timber
on the other side the isthmus, enough to build a few small vessels was
carried over the mountains. When the men began to work it, they found it
worm-eaten; and a new supply was procured, which was almost immediately
washed away by a sudden rise of the Rio Balsas, on whose banks they had
established their ship-yard. At last, however, two little vessels were built
and navigated to the Islas de las Perlas, whence Vasco Nuñez made a short
and unsuccessful cruise to the southward. But before he went a second time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he sent Garabito and other emissaries to Acla to discover whether Pedrárias
had been superseded. It seems to have been arranged that when these
men arrived near Acla one of their number should go secretly to the house
of Vasco Nuñez there and obtain the required information. If a new
governor had arrived they were to return to the southern side of the
isthmus, and Vasco Nuñez would put himself and his little fleet out of the
new governor’s reach, trusting in some grand discovery to atone for his
disloyalty. Pedrárias was still governor; but Garabito proved a false friend,
and told Pedrárias that Vasco Nuñez had no idea of marrying his daughter:
on the contrary, he intended to sail away with his native mistress (with
whom Garabito was in love) and found for himself a government on the
shores of the Mar del Sur. Pedrárias was furious, and enticed Vasco Nuñez
to Acla, where this new charge of treason, added to the former one of the
murder of Nicuesa, secured his conviction by the <i>alcalde mayor</i> Espinosa,
and on the very next day he and his four companions were executed. This
was in 1517.</p>

<p>In 1519 Pedrárias removed the seat of government from Antigua to
Panamá, which was made a city in 1521, while Antigua was not long after
abandoned. In 1519 Espinosa coasted northward and westward, in Vasco
Nuñez’ vessels, as far as the Gulf of Culebras; and in 1522 Pascual de Andagoya
penetrated the country of Birú for twenty leagues or more, when ill
health compelled his return to Panamá. He brought wonderful accounts
of an Inca empire which was said to exist somewhere along the coast to
the south.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>In 1519 a pilot, Andrés Niño by name, who had been with Vasco Nuñez
on his last cruise, interested Gil Gonzalez de Avila, then <i>contador</i> of Española,
in the subject of exploration along the coast of the South Sea.
Gonzalez agreed to go as commander-in-chief, accompanying Niño in the
vessels which Vasco Nuñez had built. The necessary orders from the King
were easily obtained, and they sailed for Antigua, where they arrived safely;
but Pedrárias refused to deliver the vessels. Gil Gonzalez, nothing daunted,
took in pieces the ships by which he had come from Spain, transported the
most important parts of them across the isthmus, and built new vessels.
These, however, were lost before reaching Panamá; but the crews arrived
there in safety, and Pedrárias, when brought face to face with the commander,
could not refuse to obey the King’s orders. Thus, after many
delays, Gil Gonzalez and Andrés Niño sailed from the Islas de las Perlas
on the 21st of January, 1522. After they had gone a hundred leagues or
more, it was found necessary to beach and repair the vessels. This was
done by Niño, while Gil Gonzalez, with one hundred men and four horses,
pushed along the shore, and, after many hairbreadth escapes, rejoined
the fleet, which under Niño had been repaired and brought around by water.
The meeting was at a gulf named by them Sanct Viçente; but it proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to be the San Lucar of Hurtado, and the Nicoya of the present day.
After a short time passed in recuperation, the two detachments again
separated. Niño with the vessels coasted the shore at least as far as the
Bay of Fonseca, and thence returned to the Gulf of Nicoya. Here he was
soon rejoined by the land party; which, after leaving the gulf, had penetrated
inland to the Lake of Nicaragua. They explored the surrounding
country sufficiently to discover the outlet of the lake, which led to
the north, and not to the south, as had been hoped. They had but
one severe fight with the natives, accumulated vast sums of gold, and
baptized many thousand converts. With their treasure they returned in
safety to Panamá on the 25th of June, 1523, after an absence of nearly a
year and a half.</p>

<p>At Panamá Gil Gonzalez found an enemy worse than the natives of
Nicaragua in the person of Pedrárias, whose cupidity was aroused by the
sight of the gold. But crossing the isthmus, he escaped from Nombre de
Dios just as Pedrárias was on the point of arresting him, and steered for
Española, where his actions were approved by the Hieronimite Fathers, who
authorized him to return and explore the country. This he endeavored
to do by the way of the outlet of the Lake of Nicaragua, by which route he
would avoid placing himself in the power of Pedrárias. He unfortunately
reached the Honduras coast too far north, and marched inland only to be
met by a rival party of Spaniards under Hernando de Soto. It seemed
that as soon as possible after Gil Gonzalez’ departure from Nombre de
Dios, Pedrárias had despatched a strong force under Francisco Hernandez
de Córdoba to take possession of and hold the coveted territory for him.
Córdoba, hearing from the natives of Spaniards advancing from the north,
had sent De Soto to intercept them. Gil Gonzalez defeated this detachment;
but not being in sufficient force to meet Córdoba, he retreated to
the northern shore, where he found Cristóbal de Olid, who had been sent
by Cortés to occupy Honduras in his interest. Olid proved a traitor to
Cortés, and soon captured not only Gil Gonzalez, but Francisco de las
Casas, who had been sent by Cortés to seize him. Las Casas, who was
a man of daring, assassinated Olid, with the help of Gil Gonzalez.
The latter was then sent to make what terms he could with Cortés as
to a joint occupation of the country.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> But Gil Gonzalez fell into the
hands of the enemies of the Conqueror of Mexico, and was sent to Spain
to answer, among other things, for the murder of Olid. He reached
Seville in 1526; but, completely overwhelmed by his repeated disasters,
died soon after.</p>

<p>Córdoba, who had thrown off allegiance to Pedrárias, was executed.
Pedrárias himself was turned out of his government of Darien by Pedro
de los Rios, and took refuge in the governorship of Nicaragua, and died
quietly at Leon in 1530, at the advanced age of nearly ninety years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1492 Christopher Columbus had discovered Cuba, which he called
Juana; and two years later he had partially explored the Island of Jamaica,
whither he had been driven on his fourth voyage, and compelled to stay
from June, 1503, to June, 1504. In 1508 this lesser island had been granted
to Ojeda and Nicuesa as a storehouse from which to draw supplies in case
of need. But, as we have seen, the Admiral of the Indies at that time,
Diego Columbus, son of the great Admiral, had sent Juan de Esquivel with
sixty men to seize the island and hold it for him against all comers.
Esquivel founded the town of Sevilla Nueva&mdash;later Sevilla d’Oro&mdash;on the
shores of the harbor where Columbus had stayed so long; and thus the
island was settled.</p>

<p>Although Cuba had been discovered in 1492, nothing had been done
toward its exploration till 1508, when Ovando, at that time governor of
Española, sent Sebastian de Ocampo to determine whether it was an island
or not. Columbus, it will be remembered, did not, or would not, believe
it insular, though the Indians whom he brought from Guanahani had told
him it was; and it had suited his purpose to make his companions swear
that they believed it a peninsula of Asia. Ocampo settled the question
by circumnavigating it from north to south; and, after another delay, Diego
Columbus in 1511 sent Diego Velasquez, a wealthy planter of Española,
to conquer and settle the island, which at that time was called Fernandina.
Velasquez, assisted by thirty men under Pamphilo de Narvaez from Jamaica,
had no difficulty in doing this; and his task being accomplished, he threw
off his allegiance to the Admiral. Settlers were attracted to Cuba from all
sides. With the rest came one hundred, Bernal Diaz among them, from
Antigua. But Velasquez had distributed the natives among his followers
with such a lavish hand that these men were unable to get any slaves for
themselves, and in this predicament agreed with Francisco Hernandez de
Córdoba<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> to go on a slave-catching expedition to some neighboring islands.
Velasquez probably contributed a small vessel to the two vessels which were
fitted out by the others. With them went Anton Alaminos as pilot. Sailing
from Havana in February, 1517, they doubled the Cabo de S. Anton, and
steered toward the west and south. Storms and currents drove them from
their course, and it was not until twenty-one days had passed after leaving
S. Anton that they sighted some small islands. Running toward the
coast, they espied inland a city, the size of which so impressed them that
they called it <i>El gran Cairo</i>. Soon after some natives came on board, who,
to their inquiries as to what land it was, answered “Conex Catoche;” and
accordingly they named it the Punta de Catoche. At this place, having
landed, they were enticed into an ambush, and many Spaniards were killed.
From this inhospitable shore they sailed to the west, along the northern
coast of Yucatan, and in two weeks arrived at a village which they named
S. Lázaro, but to which the native name of Campeche has clung.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>There the natives were hostile. So they sailed on for six days more, when they
arrived off a village called Pontonchan, now known, however, as Champoton.
As they were short of water they landed at this place, and in a fight which
followed, fifty-seven Spaniards were killed and five were drowned. Nevertheless
the survivors continued their voyage for three days longer, when
they came to a river with three mouths, one of which, the Estero de los
Lagartos, they entered. There they burned one of their vessels; and, having
obtained a supply of water, sailed for Cuba. The reports which they
gave of the riches of the newly discovered country so excited the greed of
Velasquez that he fitted out a fleet of four vessels, the command of which
he gave to his nephew, Juan de Grijalva. Anton Alaminos again went as
pilot, and Pedro de Alvarado was captain of one of the ships. They left
the Cabo de S. Anton on the 1st of May, 1518, and three days later sighted
the Island of Cozumel, which they called Santa Cruz. From this island they
sailed along the southern coast of Yucatan, which they thought an island,
and which they named Santa Maria de los Remedios. They came finally
to a shallow bay, still known by the name which they gave it, Bahia de la
Ascension. But the prospect not looking very promising in this direction,
they doubled on their track, and in due season arrived at S. Lázaro (Campeche),
or, more probably, perhaps, at Champoton, where they had their
first hostile encounter with the natives. But, being better provided with
artillery and cotton armor than was Francisco Hernandez, Grijalva and his
men maintained their ground and secured a much-needed supply of water.
Thence following the shore, they soon came to an anchorage, which they
at first called Puerto Deseado. On further investigation the pilot Alaminos
declared that it was not a harbor, but the mouth of a strait between the
island of Santa Maria de los Remedios (Yucatan) and another island, which
they called Nueva España, but which afterward proved to be the mainland
of Mexico. They named this strait the Boca de Términos. After recuperating
there, they coasted toward the north by the mouths of many rivers,
among others the Rio de Grijalva (Tabasco), until they came to an island
on which they found a temple, where the native priests were wont to
sacrifice human beings. To this island they gave the name of Isla de los
Sacrificios; while another, a little to the north, they called S. Juan de Ulúa.
The sheet of water between this island and the mainland afforded good
anchorage, and to-day is known as the harbor of Vera Cruz. There Grijalva
stayed some time, trading with the inhabitants, not of the islands merely,
but of the mainland. To this he was beckoned by the waving of white
flags, and he found himself much honored when he landed. After sending
Pedro de Alvarado, with what gold had been obtained, to Cuba in a caravel
which needed repairs, Grijalva proceeded on his voyage; but when he had
arrived at some point between the Bahia de Tanguijo and the Rio Panuco,
the pilot Alaminos declared it madness to go farther. So the fleet turned
back, and, after more trading along the coast, they arrived safely at Matanzas
in October of the same year. Velasquez, when he saw the spoil gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
on this expedition, was much vexed that Grijalva had not broken his instructions
and founded a settlement. A new expedition was immediately
prepared, the command of which was given to Hernan Cortés.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> As for
Grijalva, he took service under Pedrárias, and perished with Hurtado in
Nicaragua.</p>

<h3><a name="c204" id="c204">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE best account of the voyages and expeditions of the companions of Columbus,
with the exception of those relating immediately to the settlement of Darien and the
exploration of the western coast of the isthmus, is Navarrete’s <i>Viages menores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> This historian<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
had extraordinary opportunities in this field; and a nautical education contributed
to his power of weighing evidence with regard to maritime affairs. No part of Navarrete
has been translated into English, unless the first portion of Washington Irving’s <i>Companions
of Columbus</i> may be so regarded. The best account of these voyages in English,
however, is Sir Arthur Helps’s <i>Spanish Conquest in America</i>,<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> which, although defective
in form, is readable, and, so far as it goes, trustworthy. This work deals not merely
with the <i>Viages menores</i>, but also with the settlement of Darien; as, too, does Irving’s
<i>Companions</i>.</p>

<p>The first voyage of Ojeda rests mainly on the answers to the questions propounded by
the <i>fiscal real</i> in the suit brought against Diego, the son of Columbus, in which the
endeavor was made to show that Ojeda, and not Columbus, discovered the pearl coasts.
But this claim on the part of the King’s attorney was unsuccessful; for Ojeda himself
expressly stated in his deposition, taken in Santo Domingo in 1513, that he was the first
man who went to Tierra-Firme <i>after</i> the Admiral, and that he knew that the Admiral had
been there because he saw the chart<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> which the Admiral had sent home. This lawsuit is
so important in relation to these minor voyages that Navarrete printed much of the testimony
then taken, with some notes of his own, at the end of his third volume.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> Among
the witnesses were Ojeda, Bastidas, Vicente Yañez Pinzon, Garcia Hernandez a “<i>fisico</i>,”
who had accompanied Vicente Yañez on his first voyage, the pilots Ledesma, Andrés de
Morales, Juan Rodriguez, and many other mariners who had sailed with the different
commanders. Their testimony was taken with regard to the third voyage of Columbus
(second question); the voyage of Guerra and Niño (third and fourth questions); Ojeda’s
first voyage (fifth question); Bastidas (sixth question); Vicente Yañez (seventh question);
Lepe (eighth question); etc. Taken altogether, this evidence is the best authority
for what was done or was not done on these early voyages.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The only things worth noting in the voyage of Guerra and Niño are the smallness of
the vessel (fifty tons),<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> and the enormous pecuniary return. One of the voyagers,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> very
possibly Niño himself,<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> wrote an account of the voyage, which was translated into Italian,
and published as chapters cx. and cxi. of the <i>Paesi novamente retrovati</i>. It was then
translated into Latin, and inserted by Grynæus in the <i>Novus orbis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>A contemporary account of the voyage of Vicente Yañez Pinzon was printed in the
<i>Paesi novamente</i>,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> by whom written is not known. Varnhagen has attempted to show
that the cape near which Vicente Yañez landed was not the Cabo de S. Augustin, but
some point much farther north.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> For a time the point was raised that Vicente Yañez
arrived on the coast after Cabral; but that was plainly impossible, as he undoubtedly
sighted the American coast before Cabral left Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> As to the landfall itself, both
Navarrete and Humboldt place it in about eight degrees south latitude; and they base
their argument on the answers to the seventh question of the <i>fiscal real</i> in the celebrated
lawsuit, in which Vicente Yañez said that it was true that he discovered from “El
cabo de Consolacion que es en la parte de Portugal é agora se llama cabo de S. Augustin.”<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>
In this he was corroborated by the other witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The voyage was unsuccessful
in a pecuniary point of view. Two vessels were lost at the Bahamas, whither Vicente
Yañez had gone in quest of slaves. After his return to Spain it was only through the
interposition of the King that he was able to save a small portion of his property from the
clutches of the merchants who had fitted out the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>The voyage of Diego de Lepe rests entirely on the evidence given in the Columbus
lawsuit,<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> from which it also appears that he drew a map for Fonseca on which the coast
of the New World was delineated trending toward the south and west from Rostro Hermoso
(Cabo de S. Augustin). Little is known of the further movements of Diego de Lepe,
who, according to Morales, died in Portugal before 1515.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Navarrete printed nothing
relating to him of a later date than November, 1500;<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> but in the <i>Documentos inéditos</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
are documents which would seem to show that he was preparing for a voyage in the beginning
of 1502.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>Juan de la Cosa returned with Ojeda in the middle of June, 1500, and he sailed with
Bastidas in the following October. The intervening time he probably spent in working
on the map which bears the legend “Juan de la Cosa la fizo en Puerto de Sta.
Maria en año de 1500.” This is the earliest existing chart made by one of the navigators
of the fifteenth century, the track-chart sent home by Columbus in 1498,<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> and the Lepe map,
being lost. Humboldt was especially qualified to appreciate the clearness and accuracy
of this La Cosa map by the knowledge of the geography of Spanish America which he
gained during a long sojourn in that part of the world;<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and this same knowledge gives
especial value to whatever he says in the <i>Examen critique</i><a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> concerning the voyages herein
described. Of Juan de la Cosa’s knowledge of the geography of the northern coast of
South America there can be little doubt, especially when it is borne in mind that he made
no less than six voyages to that part of the world,<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> only two of which, however, preceded
the date which he gives to his map. A comparison of La Cosa’s map with the chart of
1527 usually, but probably erroneously, ascribed to Ferdinand Columbus, and with that of
1529 by Ribero, gives a clearer idea than the chronicles themselves do, of the discoveries
of the early navigators.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Like all these early minor voyages, that of Rodrigo Bastidas rests mainly on the testimony
given in the lawsuit already referred to.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> Navarrete in his <i>Viages menores</i> stated
that Ojeda procured a license from Bishop Fonseca, who had been empowered to give
such licenses. No document, however, of the kind has been produced with regard to
Ojeda or any of these commanders before the time of Bastidas, whose <i>Asiento que hizo
con SS. MM. Católicas</i> of June 5, 1500, has been printed.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> As already related, the ravages
of the teredo drove Bastidas into a harbor of Española, where he was forced to abandon
his vessels and march to Santo Domingo. He divided his men into three bands, who
saved themselves from starvation by exchanging for food some of the ornaments which
they had procured on the coast of Tierra-Firme. This innocent traffic was declared
illegal by Bobadilla, who sent Bastidas to Spain for trial. But two years later, on Jan. 29,
1504, their Majesties ordered his goods to be restored to him, and commanded that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
further proceedings should be abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> They also granted him a pension of fifty
thousand maravedis, to be paid from the revenues “de los Golfos de Huraba e Barú;”<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>
while Juan de la Cosa was not only pensioned in a similar fashion, but also made <i>alguacil
mayor</i> of the Gulf of Urabá.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> With the exception of a slave-catching voyage to Urabá
in 1504, Bastidas lived quietly as a farmer in Española until 1520, when he led an expedition
to settle the province of Santa Marta, and was there killed by his lieutenant. After
his death his family, seeking to receive compensation for his services and losses, drew
up an <i>Informacion de los servicios del adelantado Rodrigo de Bastidas</i>;<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> and eight years
later presented another.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> From this material it is possible to construct a clear and
connected account of this voyage, especially when supplemented by Oviedo and Las
Casas.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<p>This was the first voyage which really came within the scope of Hubert H. Bancroft’s
<i>Central America</i>; and therefore he has described it at some length.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> This book is a vast
and invaluable mine of information, to be extracted only after much labor and trouble,
owing to a faulty table of contents, and the absence of side-notes or dates to the pages;
and there is at present no index. The text is illustrated with a mass of descriptive and
bibliographical notes which are really the feature of the work, and give it its encyclopedic
value. Considering its range and character, the book has surprisingly few errors
of any kind; and indeed the only thing which prevents our placing implicit reliance on it
is Mr. Bancroft’s assertion<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> that “very little of the manuscript as it comes to me, whether
in the form of rough material or more finished chapters, is the work of one person alone;”
while we are not given the means of attaching responsibility where it belongs, as regards
both the character of the investigation and the literary form which is presented. As to
the ultimate authorship of the text itself, we are only assured<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> that “at least one half of
the manuscript has been written by my own hand.”<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The second voyage of Alonso de Ojeda rests entirely on some documents which
Navarrete printed in the third volume of his <i>Coleccion</i>, and upon which he founded his
account of the voyage.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The first, in point of time, is a <i>cédula</i> of June 8, 1501, continuing a
license of July, 1500, to explore and govern the Isla de Coquivacoa.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Two days later, on
June 10, 1501, a formal commission as governor was given to Ojeda,<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> and the articles
of association were executed by him and his partners, Vergara and Ocampo, on the 5th
of July.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> An <i>escribano</i>, Juan de Guevara by name, was appointed in the beginning of
September of the same year. The fleet was a long time in fitting out, and it was not till
the next spring that Ojeda issued his orders and instructions to the commanders of the
other vessels and to the pilots.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> These are of great importance, as giving the names of
the places which he had visited on his first voyage. The attempt at colonization ended
disastrously, and Ojeda found himself at Santo Domingo as the defendant in a suit brought
against him by his associates. Navarrete used the evidence given in this suit in his
account; but he printed only the <i>ejecutoria</i>, in which the King and Queen ordered that
Ojeda should be set at liberty, and that his goods should be restored to him.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
position of the irrigated land<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> which he called Valfermoso is difficult to determine; but it
certainly was not the Curiana of the present day, which is identical with the Curiana of
Guerra and Niño.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>Martin Fernandez de Enciso&mdash;the <i>bachiller Enciso</i>&mdash;“first came to the Indies with
Bastidas,” says Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> and practised law to such good purpose that he accumulated two
thousand castellanos,&mdash;equivalent to ten thousand in our day.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> This he contributed
toward the expenses of the Nueva Andalucia colony, of which he was made <i>alcalde mayor</i>.
But he was unfortunate in that office, as we have seen, and was sent to Spain, whence he
returned in 1513 with Pedrárias as <i>alguacil mayor</i>. In 1514 he led an expedition to Cenú,
to which Irving erroneously gives an earlier date.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> From 1514 to 1519 nothing is known
of Enciso’s movements; but in the latter year he published the <i>Suma de geografía que
trata de todas las partidas y provincias del mundo, en especial de las Indias</i>, which contains
much bearing on this period. What became of the author is not known.</p>

<p>The trading voyages to Tierra-Firme between Ojeda’s two attempts at colonization
have no geographical importance; and, indeed, their very existence depends on a few
documents which were unearthed from the Archives of the Indies by the indefatigable
labors of Muñoz, Navarrete, and the editors of the <i>Coleccion de documentos inéditos relativos
al descubrimiento, conquista y organizacion de las antiguas posesiones Españolas de
América y Oceania</i>.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Of these trading voyages first comes the cruise of Juan de la Cosa, or
Juan Vizcaino, as he was sometimes called, whose intention to embark upon it is inferred
from a letter from the Queen to the royal officers,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> and an <i>asiento</i> bearing date Feb. 14,
1504.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Nothing is known of the voyage itself, except that Navarrete, on the authority
of a <i>cédula</i> which he did not print, gives the amount of money received by the Crown as
its share of the profits.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>The voyage which Ojeda is supposed to have made in 1505 rests on a still weaker
foundation, as there is nothing with regard to it except a <i>cédula</i>, bearing date Sept. 21,
1505,<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> concerning certain valuables which may have been procured on this voyage or on
the first ill-fated attempt at colonization. That it was contemplated is ascertained from a
<i>Cédula para que Alfonso Doxeda sea Gobernador de la Costa de Ququebacóa e Huraba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
etc. The document, dated Sept. 21, 1504, is followed by two of the same date referring
to Ojeda’s financial troubles. Is it not possible that the above-mentioned document
of Sept. 21, 1505, belongs with them? The agreement (<i>asiento</i>) of Sept. 30, 1504, confirmed
in March of the next year, is in the same volume, while an order to the Governor
of Española not to interfere with the luckless Ojeda was printed by Navarrete (iii. 111),
who has said all that can be said concerning the expedition in his <i>Noticia biográfica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>The voyage of Juan de la Cosa with Martin de los Reyes and Juan Correa rests
entirely on the assertion of Navarrete that they returned in 1508, because it was stated
(where, he does not say) that the proceeds of the voyage were so many hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
thousand maravedis.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Concerning the discovery of Yucatan by Vicente Yañez Pinzon, there
is no original material;<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> but here again evidence of preparation for a voyage can be found
in an <i>asiento y capytulacion</i> of April 24, 1505, in the <i>Documentos inéditos</i> (xxxi. 309).</p>

<p>After this time the history of Tierra-Firme is much better known; for it is with the
colonies sent out under Ojeda and Nicuesa in 1509 that the <i>Historia general</i> of Oviedo
becomes a standard authority. Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés was born in
Madrid in 1478, and in 1490 he entered the household of the Duke of Villahermoso.
Later he served under Prince Juan and the King Of Naples until 1507, when he entered
the service of the King and Queen of Spain. In 1513 he was appointed <i>escribano</i>, and
later (upon the death of Caicedo, who, it will be remembered, was one of the agents
Vasco Nuñez had sent to Spain to announce the existence of an unknown sea) <i>veedor de
las fundaciones d’oro</i> to the expedition which under Pedrárias was sent to Tierra-Firme
in that year. Oviedo did not approve of the course pursued by that worthy, and returned
to Spain in 1515 to inform the new King, Charles I. (Emperor Charles V.) of the true condition
of affairs in the Indies. He brought about many important reforms, secured for
himself the office of perpetual <i>regidor</i> of Antigua,&mdash;<i>escribano general</i> of the province,
receiver of the fines of the <i>cámara</i>,<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>&mdash;and cargoes and goods forfeited for smuggling
were also bestowed upon him. His <i>veeduría</i> was extended so as to include all Tierra-Firme;
and when the news of the execution of Vasco Nuñez arrived at Court, he
was ordered to take charge of his goods and those of his associates. Oviedo, provided
with so many offices and with an order commanding all governors to furnish him
with a true account of their doings, returned to Antigua soon after the new governor,
Lope de Sosa, who had been appointed, upon his representations, to succeed Pedrárias.
But unfortunately for him Lope de Sosa died in the harbor of Antigua (1520), and
Oviedo was left face to face with Pedrárias. It was not long before they quarrelled as to
the policy of removing the seat of government of the province from Antigua to Panamá,
which Oviedo did not approve. Pedrárias craftily made him his lieutenant at Antigua, in
which office Oviedo conducted himself so honestly that he incurred the hatred of all the
evil-disposed colonists of that town, and was forced to resign. He also complained of
Pedrárias before the new <i>alcalde mayor</i>, and was glad to go to Spain as the representative
of Antigua. On his way he stopped at Cuba and Santo Domingo, where he saw Velasquez
and Diego Columbus; with the latter he sailed for home. There he used his opportunities
so well that he procured, in 1523, the appointment of Pedro de los Rios as
Pedrárias’ successor, and for himself the governorship of Cartagena; and after publishing
his <i>Sumario</i> he returned to Castilla del Oro, where he remained until 1530, when he
returned to Spain, resigned his <i>veeduría</i>, and some time after received the appointment of
<i>Cronista general de Indias</i>. In 1532 he was again in Santo Domingo, and in 1533 he was
appointed <i>alcaid</i> of the fortress there. But the remainder of his life was passed in
literary pursuits, and he died in Valladolid in 1557 at the age of seventy-nine. From this
account it can easily be seen that whatever he wrote with regard to the affairs of Tierra-Firme
must be received with caution, as he was far from being an impartial observer.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The first document with regard to the final and successful settlement of Tierra-Firme
is the <i>cédula</i> of June 9, 1508, in which Diego de Nicuesa and Alonso de Ojeda were commissioned
governors of Veragua and Urabá for four years.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Juan de la Cosa was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
confirmed in his office of <i>alguacil mayor de Urabá</i> on the seventeenth of the same month;<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>
and the Governor of Española was directed to give him a house for his wife and children,
together with a sufficient number of Indians.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>As we have seen, the two governors were prevented by Diego Columbus from taking
the well-to-do class of colonists from Española upon which they had counted. This
statement is made on the authority of Nicuesa’s lieutenant, Rodrigo de Colmenares, who
afterward deserted Nicuesa at Antigua, and went to Spain in 1512 in company with
Caicedo to report the existence of a new sea. While there, either on this or a later visit,
he presented a memorial to the King <i>sobre el desgraciado suceso de Diego de Nicuesa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
The allegations of Colmenares are borne out by two <i>cédulas</i> of Feb. 28, 1510;<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> while a
<i>cédula</i> of June 15, 1510, declared that the Gulf of Urabá belonged to the province which
had been assigned to Ojeda.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Nicuesa was informed of this decision in a <i>cédula</i> of the
same date.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> There are four more <i>cédulas</i> of July 25, 1511, in two of which the Admiral
Diego Columbus and the treasurer Pasamonte are ordered to assist the unhappy governors,
while the other two were written to inform those governors that such orders had
been sent.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> The fate of neither of them, however, is certain. The judges of appeal in
Española were ordered to inquire into the crimes, <i>délits</i>, and excesses of Ojeda, Talavera,
and companions.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Talavera and his associates were hanged in Jamaica in 1511, and
Ojeda’s deposition was taken in 1513, and again in 1515 in Santo Domingo, in the celebrated
lawsuit; but beyond this his further movements are not accurately known.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> As
for Nicuesa, he too underwent shipwreck and starvation; and when at last fortune
seemed about to smile upon him, he was cruelly cast out by the mutinous settlers at
Darien; and although a story was current that he had been wrecked on Cuba and had
there left inscribed on a tree, “Here died the unfortunate Nicuesa,” yet the best opinion is
that he and his seventeen faithful followers perished at sea.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The only complete biography of Vasco Nuñez de Balbóa is that of Don Manuel José
Quintana,<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> who had access to the then unpublished portion of Oviedo, and to documents
many of which are possibly not yet published. His <i>Vida</i>,<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> therefore, is very useful in
filling gaps in the account of the expeditions from Antigua both before and after the
coming of Pedrárias. There is no account by an eye-witness of the expeditions undertaken
by Vasco Nuñez before 1514; and the only approach to such a document is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
letter which Vasco Nuñez wrote to the King on Jan. 20, 1513.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> The writer of this letter
came to the Indies with Bastidas in 1500; and after the unhappy ending of that voyage
settled in Española. But he was not suited to the placid life of a planter, and becoming
involved in debt, was glad to escape from his creditors in Enciso’s ship. It was by his
advice that the San Sebastian colony was transferred to the other side of the Gulf of
Urabá; and when there his shrewdness had discovered a way of getting rid of Enciso.
The exact part he played in the murder of Nicuesa is not clear; but it is certain, as
Bancroft points out, that his connection with that nefarious act was the lever by which
his enemies finally accomplished his overthrow. It can be thus easily understood that the
censures which he passes on Enciso and Nicuesa must be received with caution. Still,
we should not forget that Vasco Nuñez succeeded where they failed. He was a man of
little or no education, and portions of this letter are almost untranslatable. Nevertheless,
Clements R. Markham has given an English rendering in the Introduction to his translation
of Andagoya’s <i>Relacion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Among the other accounts,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> that of Herrera is very full,
and, so far as it can be compared with accessible documents, sufficiently accurate.</p>

<p>There is no real discrepancy in the various narratives, except with regard to the date
of the discovery of the Pacific, which Peter Martyr says took place on the 26th of September,
while all the other authorities have the 25th; Oviedo going so far as to give the
very hour when the new waters first dawned on Balbóa’s sight.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>There is no lack of original material concerning the government of Pedrárias. First
come his commission<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> (July 27, 1513) and instructions<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> (Aug. 2, 1513), which Navarrete
has printed, together with the letter written by the King on receipt of the reports of Vasco
Nuñez’ grand discovery.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The date of this paper is not given; but there has recently
been printed<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> a letter from the King to Vasco Nuñez of Aug. 19, 1514. In this note the
monarch states that he has heard of the discovery of the new sea through Pasamonte,
although he had not then seen Arbolancha. Pasamonte had probably written in Vasco
Nuñez’ favor; for the King adds that he has written to Pedrárias that he (Vasco Nuñez)
should be well treated. It is possible that this is the letter above mentioned, a portion
only of which is printed in Navarrete.</p>

<p>The date of the expedition to Dabaibe, in which so many men were lost, is not certain;
but Vasco Nuñez saw the necessity of putting forward a defence, which he did in a letter
to the King on the 16th of October, 1515.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> In this letter, besides describing the really
insuperable obstacles in the way of a successful expedition in that direction,&mdash;in which
the lack of food, owing to the ravages of the locusts, bears a prominent part,&mdash;he attacks
Pedrárias and his government very severely.</p>

<p>The doings of Arbolancha in Spain are not known. There is a letter of the King to
Pedrárias, dated Sept. 27, 1514, appointing Vasco Nuñez <i>adelantado</i> of the coast region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
which he had discovered.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> We have several letters of the King to Pedrárias, to the new
<i>adelantado</i>, and to other officers, on November 23 and 27.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>The next document of importance is the narrative of Espinosa’s expedition, written
by himself. It is printed in the <i>Documentos inéditos</i> (vol. ii. pp. 467-522), with some
corrections by the editors; but it may be found in the original spelling, and without such
corrections, in another volume of that series,<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> where the date of 1514 is most erroneously
assigned to it.</p>

<p>The <i>licenciate</i> Gaspar de Espinosa came to Tierra-Firme with Pedrárias as <i>alcalde
mayor</i>. Soon after his arrival at Antigua he held the <i>residencia</i> of Vasco Nuñez, and
then is not heard of again until he is found in command of this expedition. He founded
Panamá (for the first time) and returned to Antigua, whence he followed Pedrárias to
Acla to try Vasco Nuñez for treason. He unwillingly convicted him, but recommended
mercy. After the great explorer’s death he cruised in his vessels to the coast of
Nicaragua; and later he played an important part in the conquest of Peru, and died at
Cuzco while endeavoring to accommodate the differences between Pizarro and Almagro.
The only other document of his which I have found is a <i>Relacion e proceso</i> concerning the
voyage of 1519.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>There are a few other documents bearing on the history of Tierra-Firme;<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> but the
best and most complete contemporary account of this period<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> was written by Pascual de
Andagoya, who came to Antigua with Pedrárias. Andagoya was with Vasco Nuñez on
his last voyage, accompanied Espinosa on both his expeditions, and led a force into Birú
in 1522. After his return from that expedition he lived in Panamá until 1529, when
Pedro de los Rios banished him from the isthmus. After a few years spent in Santo
Domingo he returned to Panamá as lieutenant to the new governor, Barrionuevo, and
acted as agent to Pizarro and the other conquerors of Peru until 1536, when his <i>residencia</i>
was held with much rigor by the <i>licenciate</i> Pedro Vasquez, and he was sent to
Spain. In 1539 he returned as <i>adelantado</i> and governor of Castilla Nueva, as the province
bordering on the <i>Mar del Sur</i> from the Gulf of San Miguel to the San Juan River was
then called. But the remainder of his life was one succession of disappointments, and he
died some time after 1545.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>From this brief biography it will be seen that Andagoya’s earlier career was successful,
and that he was on friendly terms with Pedrárias, Espinosa, and Vasco Nuñez. He was
therefore, so far as we are concerned, an impartial witness of the events which he describes;
and his testimony is therefore more to be relied on than that of Oviedo, who was absent
from Tierra-Firme a great part of the time, and who was besides inimical to Pedrárias.
Otherwise Oviedo’s account is the better; for the sequence of events is difficult, if not
impossible, to unravel from Andagoya.</p>

<p>The second chronicler of the Indies, Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, who published
the first two volumes of his <i>Historia general</i> in 1601,<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> drew upon himself the wrath of
a descendant of Pedrárias, Don Francisco Arias Dávila, Conde de Puñonrostro, who
petitioned for redress. <i>Memorials</i>, <i>relaciones</i>, and <i>refutaciones</i> were given on both sides
until September, 1603, when the matter was referred to “Xil Ramirez de Arellano, del
Consexo de Su Maxestad e Su Fiscal.” This umpire decided in effect<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> that Herrera
had gone too far, and that the acrimony of some of the passages objected to should be
mitigated. The papers which passed in this discussion, after remaining for a long
time buried in the Archives of the Indies, have been printed in the thirty-seventh volume
of <i>Documentos inéditos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> and are without doubt one of the most valuable sets among the
papers in that collection. Among them are many letters from the King to the royal
officials which throw much light on the history of that time. There is nothing in them,
however, to remove the unfavorable opinion of Pedrárias which the execution of Vasco
Nuñez aroused; for although there can be little doubt that Vasco Nuñez meditated
technical treason, yet conviction for treason by the <i>alcalde mayor</i> would not have justified
execution without appeal, especially when the fair-minded judge, Gaspar Espinosa,
recommended mercy. This is perfectly clear; but the mind of Pedrárias, who presented
the facts from his point of view, in the <i>Testimónio de mandamiénto de Pedrárias Dávila
mandando proscesar a Vasco Nuñez de Balbóa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> had been poisoned by the jealous
Garabito.</p>

<p>The convicted traitors were executed without delay or appeal of any kind being given
them. The general opinion is that this execution took place in 1517, and that date has
been adopted in this chapter; but in the second volume of <i>Documentos inéditos</i> (p. 556),
there is a <i>Peticion presentada por Hernando de Arguello, á nombre de Vasco Nuñez de
Balbóa, sobre que se le prorrogue el término que se le habia dado para la construccion de
unos navíos</i>, etc., which was granted, for eight months, on the 13th day of January, 1518
(<i>en treze de Enero de quiniéntos é diez é ocho años</i>). This document is signed by Pedrárias
Dávila, Alonso de la Puente, and Diego Marquez; and it is properly attested by Martin
Salte, <i>escribáno</i>. Argüello was the principal financial supporter of Vasco Nuñez in the
South Sea enterprise, and was executed in the evening of the same day on which his
chief suffered.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>The first fifty-seven pages of the fourteenth volume of the <i>Documentos inéditos</i> are
taken up with the affairs of Gil Gonzalez Dávila. The first is an <i>asiénto</i> with the
pilot Niño, by which he was given permission to discover and explore for one thousand
leagues to the westward from Panamá. Gil Gonzalez was to go in command of the fleet,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
composed of the vessels built by Vasco Nuñez, which Pedrárias was ordered to deliver to
the new adventurers, but which he refused to do until Gil Gonzalez made the demand
in person.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>A full statement of the equipments and cost of fitting out the fleet in Spain is given
in <i>Documentos inéditos</i> (vol. xiv. pp. 8-20), and is exceedingly interesting as showing
what the Spaniards thought essential to the outfit of an exploring expedition. What was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
actually accomplished in the way of sailing, marching, and baptizing is fully set forth in
<i>Relacion de las leguas que el capitan Gil Gonzalez Dávila anduvo á pié por tierra por
la costa de la mar del Sur, y de los caciques y indios que descubrió y se babtizaron, y del
oro que dieron para Sus Magestades</i> (1522).<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>The latter part of the career of Gil Gonzalez is described in the <i>Informacion sobre
la llegada de Gil Gonzalez Dávila y Cristóbal de Olid á las Higueras</i> (Oct. 8, 1524)<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
and in the succeeding documents, especially a <i>Traslado testimoniado de una cédula del
Emperador Carlos V.... entre los capitanes Gil Gonzalez Dávila y Cristóbal
Dolid</i> (Nov. 20, 1525).<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> The <i>Relacion</i> of Andagoya<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> contains a narrative of the expedition
from a different point of view. Besides these papers, Bancroft found a document
in the Squier Collection,<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> which he cites as <i>Carta de Gil Gonzalez Dávila el Rey</i>
(March, 1524). This letter contains a great deal of detailed information, of which
Bancroft has made good use in his account of that adventurer.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p class="p2">There is no documentary evidence with regard to the settlement of Jamaica by Juan
de Esquivel, or of the circumnavigation of Cuba by Sebastian de Ocampo; and there are
but slight allusions to them in the “chroniclers.”<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> There is not much to be found concerning
the settlement of Cuba, except the accounts given by the early chroniclers.
I should place Oviedo (vol. i. p. 494) first, although he got his knowledge second hand
from the account given by Las Casas; while the story of this actual observer is necessarily
tinged by the peculiar views&mdash;peculiar for the nation and epoch&mdash;which he held in later
life with regard to the enslavement of the natives.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>With the voyage of Córdoba to Yucatan, Navarrete<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> again becomes useful, although
he printed no new evidence. The voyage, therefore, rests upon the accounts given in the
standard books,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> upon the <i>Historia verdadera</i> of Bernal Diaz, the <i>Vida de Cortés</i> in
Icazbalceta (i. 338), and a few documents recently dragged from the recesses of the Indian
Archives.</p>

<p>Bernal Diaz del Castillo came to Tierra-Firme with Pedrárias; but, discouraged with
the outlook there, he and about one hundred companions found their way to Cuba,
attracted thither by the inducements held out by Velasquez. But there again he was
doomed to disappointment, and served under Córdoba, Grijalva, and Cortés. After the
conquest of Mexico he settled in Guatemala. Whatever may be the exaggerations in
the latter part of his <i>Historia verdadera</i>,<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> there is no reason why Bernal Diaz should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
not have wished to tell the truth as to the voyages of Córdoba and Grijalva, with one or two
exceptions, to be hereafter noted.</p>

<p>Prescott, in his <i>Conquest of Mexico</i> (vol. i. p. 222), says that Córdoba sailed for one
of the neighboring Bahamas, but that storms drove him far out of his course, etc.
Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> has effectually disposed of this error. But is it not a curious fact that Bernal
Diaz and Oviedo should give the length of the voyage from Cape St. Anton to the sighting
of the islands off Yucatan as from six to twenty-one days? Oviedo was probably nearer
the mark, as it is very likely that the old soldier had forgotten the exact circumstances of
the voyage; for it must be borne in mind that he did not write his book until long after the
events which it chronicles. As to the object of the expedition, it was undoubtedly undertaken
for the purpose of procuring slaves, and very possibly Velasquez contributed a small
vessel to the two fitted out by the other adventurers;<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> but the claim set forth by the descendants
of Velasquez, that he sent four fleets <i>at his own cost</i>&mdash;<i>La una con un F. H. de
Córdoba</i><a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>&mdash;is preposterous.</p>

<p>The voyage of Juan de Grijalva was much better chronicled; for with regard to it
there are in existence three accounts written by eye-witnesses. The first is that of Bernal
Diaz,<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> which is minute, and generally accurate; but it is not unlikely that in his envy at
the praise accorded to Cortés, he may have exaggerated the virtues of Grijalva. The
latter also wrote an account of the expedition, which is embodied in Oviedo,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> together
with corrections suggested by Velasquez, whom Oviedo saw in 1523.</p>

<p>But before these I should place the <i>Itinerario</i> of Juan Diaz, a priest who accompanied
the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> The original is lost; but an Italian version is known, which was printed
with the <i>Itinerario de Varthema</i> at Venice, in 1520.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> This edition was apparently
unknown to Navarrete, who gives 1522 as the date of its appearance in Italian, in which
he is followed by Ternaux-Compans and Prescott.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this mass of original material, it is not easy to construct a connected
narrative of this voyage, for Oviedo sometimes contradicts himself; Bernal Diaz had
undoubtedly forgotten the exact dates, which he nevertheless attempts to give in too many
cases; Juan Diaz, owing partly to the numerous translations and changes incidental
thereto, is sometimes unintelligible; and Las Casas,<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> who had good facilities for getting
at the exact truth, is often very vague and difficult to follow.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN a previous section on the early maps of the Spanish and Portuguese discoveries
the Editor has traced the development of the geography of the Gulf of Mexico
with the group of the Antilles and the neighboring coasts, beginning with the delineation
of La Cosa in 1500. He has indicated in the same section the influence of the
explorations of Columbus and his companions in shaping the geographical ideas of
the early years of the sixteenth century. Balbóa’s discovery in 1513 was followed by
the failure to find any passage to the west in the latitude of the Antilles; but the
disappointment was not sufficient to remove the idea of such a passage from the minds
of certain geographers for some years to come. The less visionary among them hesitated
to embrace the notion, however, and we observe a willingness to be confined by
something like definite knowledge in the maker of a map of the Pacific which is preserved
in the Military Library at Weimar. This map shows Cordova’s discoveries
about Yucatan (1517), but has no indication of the islands which Magellan discovered
(1520) in the Pacific; accordingly, Kohl places it in 1518. Balbóa’s discovery is noted
in the sea which was seen by the Castilians.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

Gulf in 1519. This was the map sent to Spain by Garay, the governor of Jamaica.
What seems to be the mouth of the Mississippi will be noted as the “Rio del

Cortés sent to Europe was published in 1524, and is given to the reader on another

<p>There is a sketch of the northern shore of South America and the “Insule Canibalorum
sive Antiglie” which was made by Lorenz Friess (Laurentius Frisius) in 1522.
The outline, which is given herewith, represents one of the sheets of twelve woodcut
maps which were not published till 1530&mdash;under the title <i>Carta marina navigatoria
Portugalensium</i>. Friess does not mention whence he got his material, which seems
to be of an earlier date than the time of using it; and Kohl suspects it came from
Waldseemüller. South America is marked “Das nüw Erfunde land.”</p>

<p>In the Maiollo map of 1527 we find two distinct features,&mdash;the strait, connecting
with the Pacific, which Cortés had been so anxious to find; and the insular Yucatan
pushed farther than usual into the Gulf. The notion that Yucatan was an island is said
to have arisen from a misconception of the meaning of the designation which the Indians
applied to the country.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> The Portuguese Portulano of 1514-1518<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> had made Yucatan a
peninsula; but four years later Grijalva had been instructed to sail round it, and Cortés in
his map of 1520 had left an intervening channel.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> We see the uncertainty which prevailed

the Toreno map,<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> and in

Diego Ribero, a Portuguese in the service of Spain, who had been the royal cosmographer
since 1523,&mdash;an office which he was to hold till his death, ten years later, in 1533.
There are two early copies of this map, of which a small section is herewith given; both
are on parchment, and are preserved respectively at Weimar and Rome, though Thomassy<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
says there is a third copy. The Roman copy is in the Archivio del Collegio di
Propaganda, and is said to have belonged to Cardinal Borgia. The North American sections
of the map have been several times reproduced in connection with discussions of the
voyages of Gomez and Verrazano.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> The entire American continent was first engraved by
M. C. Sprengel in 1795, after a copy then in Büttner’s library at Jena, when it was appended
to a German translation of Muñoz, with a memoir upon it which was also printed separately
as <i>Ueber Ribero’s älteste Weltkarte</i>. The map is entitled <i>Carta universal en que<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
se contiene todo lo que del mundo se ha descubierto fasta agora: Hizola Diego Ribero
cosmographo de su magestad: año de 1529. La Qual se divide en dos partes conforme á
la capitulaçion que hizieron los catholicos Reyes de España, y el Rey don Juan de portugal
en la Villa [citta] de Tordesillas: Año de 1494</i>,&mdash;thus recording the Spanish understanding,
as the map of 1527 did, of the line of demarcation. The Propaganda copy has
“en Sevilla” after the date. The most serviceable of the modern reproductions of the
American parts is that given by Kohl in his <i>Die beiden ältesten General-Karten von
Amerika</i>, though other drafts of parts are open to the student in Santarem’s <i>Atlas</i>
(pl. xxv.), Lelewel’s <i>Moyen-âge</i> (pl. xli.), Ruge’s <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>,
and Bancroft’s <i>Central America</i> (i. 146).<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>These two maps of 1527 and 1529 established a type of the American coasts which
prevailed for some time. One such map is that of which a fac-simile is given in the
<i>Cartas de Indias</i>, called “Carta de las Antillas, seno Mejicano y costas de tierra-firme, y
de la America setentrional,” which seems, however, to have been made later than 1541.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>
Another is preserved in the Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel, of which Harrisse makes
mention in his <i>Cabots</i>, p. 185. A significant map of this type, commonly cited as the
<i>Atlas de Philippe II., dédié à Charles Quint</i>, is more correctly defined in the title given
to a photographic reproduction,<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> <i>Portulano de Charles Quint donné à Philippe II.,
accompagné d’une notice par MM. F. Spitzer et Ch. Wiener</i>, Paris, 1875. The map
is not dated; but the development of the coasts of Florida, California, Peru, and of Magellan’s
Straits, with the absence of the coast-line of Chili, which had been tracked in 1536,
has led to the belief that it represents investigations of a period not long before 1540.
The original draft first attracted attention when exhibited in 1875 at the Geographical
Congress in Paris, and shortly after it was the subject of several printed papers.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Major
is inclined to think it the work of Baptista Agnese, and Wieser is of the same opinion;
while for the American parts it is contended that the Italian geographer&mdash;for the language
of the map is Italian&mdash;followed the maps of 1527 and 1529.</p>

<p>What would seem to be the earliest engraved map of this type exists, so far as is
known, in but a single copy, now in the Lenox Library. It is a woodcut, measuring
21 × 17 inches, and is entitled <i>La carta uniuersale della terra firma &amp; Isole delle Indie
occidētali, cio è del mondo nuouo fatta per dichiaratione delli libri delle Indie, cauata da
due carte da nauicare fatte in Sibilia da li piloti della Maiesta Cesarea</i>,&mdash;the maps
referred to being those of 1527 and 1529, as is supposed. Harrisse, however, claims that
this Venice cut preceded the map of 1527, and was probably the work of the same chartmaker.
Stevens holds that it followed both of these maps, and should be dated 1534;
while Harrisse would place it before Peter Martyr’s death in September, 1526. According
to Brevoort and Harrisse,<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> the map was issued to accompany the conglomerate work of
Martyr and Oviedo, <i>Summario de la generale historia de l’Indie occidentali</i>, which was
printed in three parts at Venice in 1534.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> Murphy, in his <i>Verrazzano</i> (p. 125), quotes the
colophon of the Oviedo part of the book as evidence of the origin of the map, which
translated stands thus: “Printed at Venice in the month of December, 1534.”</p>

<p>For the explanation of these books there has been made a universal map of the countries of
all the West Indies, together with a special map [Hispaniola] taken from two marine
charts of the Spaniards, one of which belonged to Don Pietro Martire, councillor of the
Royal Council of said Indies, and was made by the pilot and master of marine charts,
Niño Garzia de Loreno [<i>sic</i>] in Seville; the other was made also by a pilot of his Majesty,
the Emperor, in Seville. Quaritch<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> says that an advertisement at the end of the <i>secundo
libro</i> of Xeres, <i>Conquista del Peru</i> (Venice, 1534), shows that the map in the first edition
of Peter Martyr’s <i>Decades</i> was made by Nuño Garcia de Toreno in Seville; but the statement
is questionable. Harrisse refers to a map of Toreno preserved in the Royal Library
at Turin, dated 1522, in which he is called “piloto y maestro de cartas de nauegar de su
Magestad.” The American part of this last chart is unfortunately missing.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>Harrisse calls this Lenox woodcut the earliest known chart of Spanish origin which
is crossed by lines of latitude and longitude, and thinks it marks a type adopted by the
Spanish cosmographers a little after the return of Del Cano from his voyage of circumnavigation
and the coming of Andagoya from Panama in 1522, with additions based on
the tidings which Gomez brought to Seville in December, 1525, from his voyage farther
north.</p>

<p>There is a French map, which was found by Jomard in the possession of a noble
family in France, which Kohl supposes to be drawn in part from Ribero. A sketch is
annexed as of “An Early French Map.” The absence of the Gulf of California and of all
traces of De Soto’s expedition leads Kohl to date it before 1533. Jomard placed the
date later; but as the map has no record of the expeditions of Ribault and Laudonnière,
it would appear to be earlier than 1554.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>There is a large manuscript map in the British Museum which seems to have been
made by a Frenchman from Spanish sources, judging from the mixture and corruption of
the languages used in it. In one inscription there is mention of “the disembarkation
of the Governor;” and this, together with the details of the harbors on the west coast
of Florida, where Narvaez went, leads Kohl to suppose the map to have been drawn from
that commander’s reports. The sketch, which is annexed and marked “Gulf of Mexico,
1536,” follows Kohl’s delineation in his Washington collection.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pc1 large">ANCIENT FLORIDA.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY JOHN GILMARY SHEA, LL.D.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE credit of being the first to explore our Atlantic coast has not yet
been positively awarded by critical historians. Ramusio preserves the
report of a person whom he does not name, which asserts that Sebastian
Cabot claimed for his father and himself, in the summer of 1497, to have
run down the whole coast, from Cape Breton to the latitude of Cuba;
but the most recent and experienced writer on Cabot treats the claim as
unfounded.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>The somewhat sceptical scholars of our day have shown little inclination
to adopt the theory of Francisco Adolpho de Varnhagen, that Americus
Vespucius on his first voyage reached Honduras in 1497, and during the
ensuing year ran along the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico, doubled
the Florida cape, and then sailed northward along our Atlantic coast to the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, where he built a vessel and sailed to Cadiz.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>Although Columbus made his first landfall on one of the Bahamas, and
Cuba was soon after occupied, no definite knowledge seems to have been
obtained of the great mainland so near them. There is nothing in narrative
or map to betray any suspicion of its existence prior to the year 1502, when
a map executed in Lisbon at the order of Cantino, an Italian merchant, for
Hercules d’Este, shows a mainland north of Cuba, terminating near that
island in a peninsula resembling Florida. The tract of land thus shown
has names of capes and rivers, but they can be referred to no known
exploration. To some this has seemed to be but a confused idea of Cuba
as mainland;<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> by others it is regarded as a vague idea of Yucatan. But
Harrisse in his <i>Corte-Real</i>, where he reproduces the map, maintains that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
“between the end of 1500 and the summer of 1502 navigators, whose name
and nationality are unknown, but whom we presume to be Spaniards, discovered,
explored, and named the part of the shore of the United States
which from the vicinity of Pensacola Bay runs along the Gulf of Mexico
to the Cape of Florida, and, turning it, runs northward along the Atlantic
coast to about the mouth of the Chesapeake or Hudson.”<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<p>But leaving these three claims in the realm of conjecture and doubt, we
come to a period of more certain knowledge.</p>

<p>The Lucayos of the Bahamas seem to have talked of a great land of
Bimini not far from them. The Spaniards repeated the story; and in the
edition of Peter Martyr’s <i>Decades</i> published in 1511 is a map on which
a large island appears, named “Illa de Beimeni, parte.”<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>Discovery had taken a more southerly route; no known Spanish vessel
had passed through the Bahama channel or skirted the coast. But some
ideas must have prevailed, picked up from natives of the islands, or adventurous
pilots who had ventured farther than their instructions authorized.
Stories of an island north of Hispaniola, with a fountain whose waters
conferred perpetual youth, had reached Peter Martyr in Spain, for in the
same edition of his <i>Decades</i> he alludes to the legends.</p>

<p>John Ponce de Leon, who had accompanied Columbus on his second
voyage, and had since played his part bravely amid the greatest vicissitudes,
resolved to explore and conquer Bimini. He had friends at Court, and
seems to have been a personal favorite of the King, who expressed a wish
for his advancement.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> The patent he solicited was based on that originally
issued to Columbus; but the King laughingly said, that it was one thing
to grant boundless power when nothing was expected to come of it, and
very different to do so when success was almost certain. Yet on the 23d
of February, 1512, a royal grant empowered John Ponce de Leon “to proceed
to discover and settle the Island of Bimini.”<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> The patent was subject
to the condition that the island had not been already discovered. He
was required to make the exploration within three years, liberty being
granted to him to touch at any island or mainland not subject to the King
of Portugal. If he succeeded in his expedition he was to be governor
of Bimini for life, with the title of <i>adelantado</i>.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>The veteran immediately purchased a vessel, in order to go to Spain
and make preparations for the conquest of Bimini. But the authorities in
Porto Rico seized his vessel; and the King, finding his services necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in controlling the Indians, sent orders to the Council of the Indies to defer
the Bimini expedition, and gave Ponce de Leon command of the fort in
Porto Rico.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>Thus delayed in the royal service, Ponce de Leon was unable to obtain
vessels or supplies till the following year. He at last set sail from the port
of San German in Porto Rico in March, 1513,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> with three caravels, taking
as pilot Anton de Alaminos, a native of Palos who had as a boy accompanied
Columbus, and who was long to associate his own name with explorations
of the Gulf of Mexico. They first steered northeast by north, and
soon made the Caicos, Yaguna, Amaguayo, and Manigua. After refitting
at Guanahani, Ponce de Leon bore northwest; and on Easter Sunday
(March 27) discovered the mainland, along which he ran till the 2d of
April, when he anchored in 30° 8’ and landed. On the 8th he took possession
in the name of the King of Spain, and named the country&mdash;which
the Lucayos called Cancio&mdash;Florida, from Pascua Florida, the Spanish
name for Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>The vessels then turned southward, following the coast till the 20th,
when Ponce landed near Abayoa, a cluster of Indian huts. On attempting
to sail again, he met such violent currents that his vessels could make
no headway, and were forced to anchor, except one of the caravels, which
was driven out of sight. On landing at this point Ponce found the Indians
so hostile that he was obliged to repel their attacks by force. He named
a river Rio de la Cruz; and, doubling Cape Corrientes on the 8th of May,
sailed on till he reached a chain of islands, to which he gave the name of
the Martyrs. On one of these he obtained wood and water, and careened
a caravel. The Indians were very thievish, endeavoring to steal the anchors
or cut the cables, so as to seize the ships. He next discovered and named
the Tortugas. After doubling the cape, he ran up the western shore of
Florida to a bay, in 27° 30’, which for centuries afterward bore the name
of Juan Ponce. There are indications that before he turned back he may
have followed the coast till it trended westward. After discovering Bahama
he is said to have despatched one caravel from Guanima under John
Perez de Ortubia, with Anton de Alaminos, to search for Bimini, while he
himself returned to Porto Rico, which he reached September 21. He was
soon followed by Ortubia, who, it is said, had been successful in his search
for Bimini.</p>

<p>Although Ponce de Leon had thus explored the Florida coast, and added
greatly to the knowledge of the Bahama group, his discoveries are not noted
in the editions of Ptolemy which appeared in the next decade, and which
retained the names of the Cantino map. The Ribeiro map (1529) gives
the Martyrs and Tortugas, and on the mainland Canico,&mdash;apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Cancio, the Lucayan name of Florida. In the so-called Leonardo da
Vinci’s Mappemonde, Florida appears as an island in a vast ocean that
rolls on to Japan.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>Elated with his success, John Ponce de Leon soon after sailed to Spain;
and, obtaining an audience of the King,&mdash;it is said through the influence
of his old master, Pero Nuñez de Guzman, Grand Comendador of Calatrava,&mdash;gave
the monarch a description of the attractive land which he had discovered.
He solicited a new patent for its conquest and settlement; and
on the 27th of September, 1514, the King empowered him to go and settle
“the Island of Brimini and the Island Florida” which he had discovered
under the royal orders. He was to effect this in three years from the
delivery of the <i>asiento</i>; but as he had been employed in His Majesty’s
service, it was extended so that this term was to date from the day he set
sail for his new province. After reducing the Caribs, he was empowered
to take of the vessels and men employed in that service whatever he chose
in order to conquer and settle Florida. The natives were to be summoned
to submit to the Catholic Faith and the authority of Spain, and they were
not to be attacked or captured if they submitted. Provision was made
as to the revenues of the new province, and orders were sent to the viceroy,
Don Diego Columbus, to carry out the royal wishes.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<p>The Carib war was not, however, terminated as promptly as the King
and his officers desired. Time passed, and adventurers in unauthorized
expeditions to Florida rendered the Indians hostile.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> It was not till 1521
that Ponce de Leon was able to give serious thought to a new expedition.
His early hopes seem to have faded, and with them the energy and impulsiveness
of his youth. He had settled his daughters in marriage, and,
free from domestic cares, offered himself simply to continue to serve the
King as he had done for years. Writing to Charles V. from Porto Rico
on the 10th of February, 1521, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Among my services I discovered, at my own cost and charge, the Island Florida
and others in its district, which are not mentioned as being small and useless; and now
I return to that island, if it please God’s will, to settle it, being enabled to carry
a number of people with which I shall be able to do so, that the name of Christ may
be praised there, and Your Majesty served with the fruit that land produces. And I also
intend to explore the coast of said island further, and see whether it is an island, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
whether it connects with the land where Diego Velasquez is, or any other; and I shall
endeavor to learn all I can. I shall set out to pursue my voyage hence in five or six
days.”<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

         <p class="pf400">Fac-simile of an engraving in Herrera, edition

</div></div>

<p>As he wrote to the Cardinal of Tortosa, he had expended all his substance
in the King’s service; and if he asked favors now it was “not
to treasure up or to pass this miserable life, but to serve His Majesty with
them and his person and all he had, and settle the land that he had discovered.”<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>He went prepared to settle, carrying clergymen for the colonists, friars
to found Indian missions, and horses, cattle, sheep, and swine. Where
precisely he made the Florida coast we do not know; but it is stated that
on attempting to erect dwellings for his colonists he was attacked by the
natives, who showed great hostility. Ponce himself, while leading his
men against his assailants, received so dangerous an arrow wound, that,
after losing many of his settlers by sickness and at the hands of the
Indians, he abandoned the attempt to plant a colony in Florida, which
had so long been the object of his hopes; and taking all on board his
vessels, he sailed to Cuba. There he lingered in pain, and died of his
wound.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>John Ponce de Leon closed his long and gallant career without solving
the problem whether Florida was an island or part of the northern continent.
Meanwhile others, following in the path he had opened, were contributing
to a more definite knowledge. Thus Diego Miruelo, a pilot, sailed from
Cuba in 1516 on a trading cruise; and running up the western shore of the
Floridian peninsula, discovered a bay which long bore his name on Spanish
maps, and was apparently Pensacola. Here he found the Indians friendly,
and exchanged his store of glass and steel trinkets for silver and gold.
Then, satisfied with his cruise, and without making any attempt to explore
the coast, he returned to Cuba.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>The next year Francis Hernandez de Cordova<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> sent from Cuba on the
8th of February two ships and a brigantine, carrying one hundred and ten
men, with a less humane motive than Miruelo’s; for Oviedo assures us
that his object was to capture on the Lucayos, or Bahama Islands, a cargo
of Indians to sell as slaves. His object was defeated by storms; and
the vessels, driven from their course, reached Yucatan, near Cape Catoche,
which he named. The Indians here were as hostile as the elements;
and Hernandez, after several sharp engagements with the natives, in which
almost every man was wounded, was sailing back, when storms again drove
his vessels from their course. Unable to make the Island of Cuba,
Alaminos, the pilot of the expedition, ran into a bay on the Florida coast,
where he had been with Ponce de Leon on his first expedition. While a
party which had landed were procuring water, they were attacked with
the utmost fury by the Indians, who, swarming down in crowds, assailed
those still in the boats. In this engagement twenty-two of the Indians were
killed, six of the Spaniards in the landing party were wounded,&mdash;including
Bernal Diaz, who records the event in his History,&mdash;and four of those
in the boats, among the number Anton de Alaminos, the pilot. The only
man in the expedition who had come away from Yucatan unwounded,
a soldier named Berrio, was acting as sentry on shore, and fell into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
hands of the Indians. The commander himself, Hernandez de Cordova,
reached Cuba only to die of his wounds.</p>

<p>This ill-starred expedition led to two other projects of settlement and
conquest. Diego Velasquez, governor of Cuba, the friend and host of
Hernandez, obtained a grant, which was referred to by Ponce de Leon in
his final letter to the King, and which resulted in the conquest of Mexico;<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
and Francis de Garay, governor of Jamaica, persuaded by Alaminos to
enter upon an exploration of the mainland, obtained permission in due
form from the priors of the Order of St. Jerome, then governors of the
Indies, and in 1519 despatched four caravels, well equipped, with a good
number of men, and directed by good pilots, to discover some strait in the
mainland,&mdash;then the great object of search.</p>

<p>Alonzo Alvarez de Pineda, the commander of the expedition, reached
the coast within the limits of the grant of Ponce de Leon, and endeavored
to sail eastward so as to pass beyond and continue the exploration. Unable,
from headwinds, to turn the Cape of Florida, he sailed westward as far
as the River Pánuco, which owes its name to him. Here he encountered
Cortés and his forces, who claimed the country by actual possession.</p>

<p>The voyage lasted eight or nine months, and possession was duly taken
for the King at various points on the coast. Sailing eastward again, Garay’s
lieutenant discovered a river of very great volume, evidently the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>
Here he found a considerable Indian town, and remained forty
days trading with the natives and careening his vessels. He ran up the
river, and found it so thickly inhabited that in a space of six leagues
he counted no fewer than forty Indian hamlets on the two banks.</p>

<p>According to their report, the land abounded in gold, as the natives wore
gold ornaments in their noses and ears and on other parts of the body. The
adventurers told, too, of tribes of giants and of pigmies; but declared the
natives to have been friendly, and well disposed to receive the Christian Faith.</p>

<p>Wild as these statements of Pineda’s followers were, the voyage settled
conclusively the geography of the northern shore of the Gulf, as it proved
that there was no strait there by which ships could reach Asia. Florida
was no longer to be regarded as an island, but part of a vast continent.
The province discovered for Garay received the name of Amichel.</p>

<p>Garay applied for a patent authorizing him to conquer and settle the
new territory, and one was issued at Burgos in 1521. By its tenor Christopher
de Tapia, who had been appointed governor of the territory discovered
by Velasquez, was commissioned to fix limits between Amichel and the
discoveries of Velasquez on the west and those of Ponce de Leon on the
east. On the map given in Navarrete,<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> Amichel extends apparently from
Cape Roxo to Pensacola Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>After sending his report and application to the King, and without awaiting
any further authority, Garay seems to have deemed it prudent to secure
a footing in the territory; and in 1520 sent four caravels under Diego de
Camargo to occupy some post near Pánuco. The expedition was ill managed.
One of the vessels ran into a settlement established by Cortés and
made a formal demand of Cortés himself for a line of demarcation, claiming
the country for Garay. Cortés seized some of the men who landed,
and learned all Camargo’s plans. That commander, with the rest of his
force, attempted to begin a settlement at Pánuco; but the territory afforded
no food, and the party were soon in such straits that, unable to wait for two
vessels which Garay was sending to their aid, Camargo despatched a caravel
to Vera Cruz to beg for supplies.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>In 1523 Garay equipped a powerful fleet and force to conquer and settle
Amichel. He sailed from Jamaica at the end of June with the famous
John de Grijalva, discoverer of Yucatan, as his lieutenant. His force comprised
thirteen vessels, bearing one hundred and thirty-six cavalry and eight
hundred and forty infantry, with a supply of field-pieces. He reached Rio
de las Palmas on the 25th of July, and prepared to begin a settlement; but
his troops, alarmed at the unpromising nature of the country, insisted on
proceeding southward. Garay yielded, and sailed to Pánuco, where he
learned that Cortés had already founded the town of San Esteban del
Puerto. Four of his vessels were lost on the coast, and one in the port.
He himself, with the rest of his force, surrendered to Cortés. He died in
Mexico, while still planning a settlement at Rio de las Palmas; but with
his death the province of Amichel passed out of existence.</p>

<p>Thus the discoveries of Ponce de Leon and of Garay, with those of
Miruelos, made known, by ten years’ effort, the coast-line from the Rio
Grande to the St. John’s in Florida.</p>

<p class="p2">The next explorations were intended to ascertain the nature of our
Atlantic coast north of the St. John’s.</p>

<p>In 1520 Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon, one of the auditors of the Island of
St. Domingo, though possessed of wealth, honors, and domestic felicity,
aspired to the glory of discovering some new land, and making it the
seat of a prosperous colony. Having secured the necessary license, he
despatched a caravel under the command of Francisco Gordillo, with
directions to sail northward through the Bahamas, and thence strike the
shore of the continent. Gordillo set out on his exploration, and near the
Island of Lucayoneque, one of the Lucayuelos, descried another caravel.
His pilot, Alonzo Fernandez Sotil, proceeded toward it in a boat, and soon
recognized it as a caravel commanded by a kinsman of his, Pedro de
Quexos, fitted out in part, though not avowedly, by Juan Ortiz de Matienzo,
an auditor associated with Ayllon in the judiciary. This caravel was returning
from an unsuccessful cruise among the Bahamas for Caribs,&mdash;the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of the expedition being to capture Indians in order to sell them as slaves.
On ascertaining the object of Gordillo’s voyage, Quexos proposed that they
should continue the exploration together. After a sail of eight or nine
days, in which they ran little more than a hundred leagues, they reached
the coast of the continent at the mouth of a considerable river, to which
they gave the name of St. John the Baptist, from the fact that they
touched the coast on the day set apart to honor the Precursor of Christ.
The year was 1521, and the point reached was, according to the estimate of
the explorers, in latitude 33° 30′.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>Boats put off from the caravels and landed some twenty men on the
shore; and while the ships endeavored to enter the river, these men were
surrounded by Indians, whose good-will they gained by presents.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>Some days later, Gordillo formally took possession of the country in
the name of Ayllon, and of his associate Diego Caballero, and of the King,
as Quexos did also in the name of his employers on Sunday, June 30, 1521.
Crosses were cut on the trunks of trees to mark the Spanish occupancy.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>Although Ayllon had charged Gordillo to cultivate friendly relations
with the Indians of any new land he might discover,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Gordillo joined
With Quexos in seizing some seventy of the natives, with whom they sailed
away, without any attempt to make an exploration of the coast.</p>

<p>On the return of the vessel to Santo Domingo, Ayllon condemned his
captain’s act; and the matter was brought before a commission, presided
over by Diego Columbus, for the consideration of some important affairs.
The Indians were declared free, and it was ordered that they should be
restored to their native land at the earliest possible moment. Meanwhile
they were to remain in the hands of Ayllon and Matienzo.</p>

<p>The latter made no attempt to pursue the discovery; but Ayllon, adhering
to his original purpose, proceeded to Spain with Francisco,&mdash;one of the
Indians, who told of a giant king and many provinces,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>&mdash;and on the 12th
of June, 1523, obtained a royal <i>cédula</i>.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> Under this he was to send out
vessels in 1524, to run eight hundred leagues along the coast, or till he
reached lands already discovered; and if he discovered any strait leading
to the west, he was to explore it. No one was to settle within the limits
explored by him the first year, or within two hundred leagues beyond the
extreme points reached by him north and south; the occupancy of the
territory was to be effected within four years; and as the conversion of
the natives was one of the main objects, their enslavement was forbidden,
and Ayllon was required to take out religious men of some Order to
instruct them in the doctrines of Christianity. He obtained a second
<i>cédula</i> to demand from Matienzo the Indians in his hands in order to
restore them to their native country.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>On his return to the West Indies, Ayllon was called on the King’s service
to Porto Rico; and finding it impossible to pursue his discovery, the time
for carrying out the <i>asiento</i> was, by a <i>cédula</i> of March 23, 1524, extended
to the year 1525.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>To secure his rights under the <i>asiento</i>, he despatched two caravels under
Pedro de Quexos to the newly discovered land early in 1525. They
regained the good-will of the natives and explored the coast for two hundred
and fifty leagues, setting up stone crosses with the name of Charles V. and
the date of the act of taking possession. They returned to Santo Domingo
in July, 1525, bringing one or two Indians from each province, who might
be trained to act as interpreters.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Matienzo began legal proceedings to vacate the <i>asiento</i>
granted by the King to Ayllon, on the ground that it was obtained surreptitiously,
and in fraud of his own rights as joint discoverer. His witnesses
failed to show that his caravel had any license to make a voyage
of exploration, or that he took any steps to follow up the discovery made;
but the suit embarrassed Ayllon, who was fitting out four vessels to sail in
1526, in order to colonize the territory granted to him. The armada from
Spain was greatly delayed; and as he expected by it a store of artillery
and muskets, as well as other requisites, he was at great loss. At last, however,
he sailed from Puerto de la Plata with three large vessels,&mdash;a caravel,
a breton, and a brigantine,&mdash;early in June, 1526.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> As missionaries he took
the famous Dominican, Antonio de Montesinos, the first to denounce Indian
slavery, with Father Antonio de Cervantes and Brother Pedro de Estrada,
of the same Order. The ships carried six hundred persons of both sexes,
including clergymen and physicians, besides one hundred horses.</p>

<p>They reached the coast, not at the San Juan Bautista, but at another
river, at 33° 40´, says Navarrete, to which they gave the name of Jordan.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
Their first misfortune was the loss of the brigantine; but Ayllon immediately
set to work to replace it, and built a small vessel such as was called
a <i>gavarra</i>,&mdash;the first instance of ship-building on our coast. Francisco, his
Indian guide, deserted him; and parties sent to explore the interior brought
back such unfavorable accounts that Ayllon resolved to seek a more fertile
district. That he sailed northward there can be little doubt; his original
<i>asiento</i> required him to run eight hundred leagues along the coast, and he,
as well as Gomez, was to seek a strait or estuary leading to the Spice
Islands. The Chesapeake was a body of water which it would be imperative
on him to explore, as possibly the passage sought. The soil of the
country bordering on the bay, superior to that of the sandy region south
of it, would seem better suited for purposes of a settlement. He at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
reached Guandape, and began the settlement of San Miguel, where the
English in the next century founded Jamestown.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></p>

<p>Here he found only a few scattered Indian dwellings of the communal
system, long buildings, formed of pine posts at the side, and covered with
branches, capable of holding, in their length of more than a hundred feet,
a vast number of families. Ayllon selected the most favorable spot on the
bank, though most of the land was low and swampy. Then the Spaniards
began to erect houses for their shelter, the negro slaves&mdash;first introduced
here&mdash;doing the heaviest portion of the toil. Before the colonists were
housed, winter came on. Men perished of cold on the caravel “Catalina,”
and on one of the other vessels a man’s legs were frozen so that the flesh
fell off. Sickness broke out among the colonists, and many died. Ayllon
himself had sunk under the pestilential fevers, and expired on St. Luke’s
Day, Oct. 18, 1526.</p>

<p>He made his nephew, John Ramirez, then in Porto Rico, his successor
as head of the colony, committing the temporary administration to Francis
Gomez. Troubles soon began. Gines Doncel and Pedro de Bazan, at the
head of some malcontents, seized and confined Gomez and the <i>alcaldes</i>, and
began a career of tyranny. The Indians were provoked to hostility, and
killed several of the settlers; the negroes, cruelly oppressed, fired the house
of Doncel. Then two settlers, Oliveros and Monasterio, demanded the
release of the lawful authorities. Swords were drawn; Bazan was wounded
and taken, Doncel fled, but was discovered near his blazing house. Gomez
and his subordinates, restored to power, tried and convicted Bazan, who
was put to death.</p>

<p>Such were the stormy beginnings of Spanish rule in Virginia. It is not
to be wondered at that with one consent the colonists soon resolved to
abandon San Miguel de Guandape. The body of Ayllon was placed on
board a tender, and they set sail; but it was not destined to reach a port
and receive the obsequies due his rank. The little craft foundered; and
of the five hundred who sailed from Santo Domingo only one hundred and
fifty returned to that island.</p>

<p class="p2">Contemporaneous with the explorations made by and under Ayllon was
an expedition in a single vessel sent out by the Spanish Government in
1524 under Stephen Gomez, a Portuguese navigator who had sailed under
Magallanes, but had returned in a somewhat mutinous manner. He took
part in a congress of Spanish and Portuguese pilots held at Badajoz to
consider the probability of finding a strait or channel north of Florida by
which vessels might reach the Moluccas. To test the question practically,
Charles V. ordered Gomez to sail to the coast of Bacallaos, or Newfoundland
and Labrador, and examine the coast carefully, in order to ascertain
whether any such channel existed. Gomez fitted out a caravel at Corunna,
in northern Spain, apparently in the autumn of 1524, and sailed across.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
After examining the Labrador coast, he turned southward and leisurely
explored the whole coast from Cape Race to Florida, from which he steered
to Santiago de Cuba, and thence to Corunna, entering that port after ten
months’ absence. He failed to discover the desired channel, and no
account in detail of his voyage is known; but the map of Ribeiro,<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> drawn
up in 1529, records his discoveries, and on its coast-line gives names
which were undoubtedly bestowed by him, confirming the statement that
he sailed southerly. From this map and the descriptions of the coast
in Spanish writers soon after, in which descriptions mention is made of his
discoveries, we can see that he noted and named in his own fashion what
we now know as Massachusetts Bay, Cape Cod, Narragansett Bay, the
Connecticut, Hudson, and Delaware rivers.</p>

<p>This voyage completed the exploration of our coast from the Rio
Grande to the Bay of Fundy; yet Sebastián Cabot in 1536 declared that
it was still uncertain whether a single continent stretched from the Mississippi
to Newfoundland.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The success of Cortés filled the Spanish mind with visions of empires
in the north rivalling that of Mexico, which but awaited the courage of
valiant men to conquer.</p>

<p>Panfilo de Narvaez, after being defeated by Cortés, whom he was sent
to supersede,<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> solicited of Charles V. a patent under which he might conquer
and colonize the country on the Gulf of Mexico, from Rio de Palmas
to Florida. A grant was made, under which he was required to found two
or more towns and erect two fortresses. He received the title of <i>adelantado</i>,
and was empowered to enslave all Indians who, after being summoned
in due form, would not submit to the Spanish King and the Christian Faith.
In an official document he styles himself Governor of Florida, Rio de
Palmas, and Espiritu Santo,&mdash;the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>Narvaez collected an armament suited to the project, and sailed from
San Lucar de Barrameda, June 17, 1527, in a fleet of five ships carrying
six hundred persons, with mechanics and laborers, as well as secular priests,
and five Franciscan friars, the superior being Father Juan Xuarez. On the
coast of Cuba his fleet was caught by a hurricane, and one vessel perished.
After refitting and acquiring other vessels, Narvaez sailed from Cuba in
March with four vessels and a brigantine, taking four hundred men and
eighty horses, his pilot being Diego Miruelo, of a family which had acquired
experience on that coast.</p>

<p>The destination was the Rio de Palmas; but his pilot proved incompetent,
and his fleet moved slowly along the southern coast of Cuba,
doubled Cape San Antonio, and was standing in for Havana when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
driven by a storm on the Florida coast at a bay which he called Bahia de
la Cruz, and which the map of Sebastian Cabot identifies with Apalache
Bay.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> Here Narvaez landed a part of his force (April 15), sending his
brigantine to look for a port or the way to Pánuco,&mdash;much vaunted by the
pilots,&mdash;and if unsuccessful to return to Cuba for a vessel that had remained
there. He was so misled by his pilots that though he was near or on the
Florida peninsula, he supposed himself not far from the rivers Pánuco and
Palmas. Under this impression he landed most of his men, and directed
his vessels, with about one hundred souls remaining on them, to follow the
coast while he marched inland. No steps were taken to insure their meeting
at the harbor proposed as a rendezvous, or to enable the brigantine and the
other ship to follow the party on land. On the 19th of April Narvaez struck
inland in a northward or northeasterly direction; and having learned a little
of the country, moved on with three hundred men, forty of them mounted.
On the 15th of the following month they reached a river with a strong current,
which they crossed some distance from the sea. Cabeza de Vaca, sent
at his own urgent request to find a harbor, returned with no encouraging tidings;
and the expedition plodded on till, on the 25th of June, they reached
Apalache,&mdash;an Indian town of which they had heard magnificent accounts.
It proved to be a mere hamlet of forty wretched cabins.</p>

<p>The sufferings of Narvaez’ men were great; the country was poverty-stricken;
there was no wealthy province to conquer, no fertile lands for
settlement. Aute (a harbor) was said to be nine days’ march to the southward;
and to this, after nearly a month spent at Apalache, the disheartened
Spaniards turned their course, following the Magdalena River. On the 31st
of July they reached the coast at a bay which Narvaez styled Bahia de
Cavallos; and seeing no signs of his vessels, he set to work to build boats
in which to escape from the country. The horses were killed for food; and
making forges, the Spaniards wrought their stirrups, spurs, and other iron
articles into saws, axes, and nails. Ropes were made of the manes and tails
of the horses and such fibres as they could find; their shirts were used for
sailcloth. By the 20th of September five boats, each twenty-two cubits long,
were completed, and two days afterward the survivors embarked, forty-eight
or nine being crowded into each frail structure. Not one of the whole
number had any knowledge of navigation or of the coast.</p>

<p>Running between Santa Rosa Island and the mainland, they coasted
along for thirty days, landing where possible to obtain food or water, but
generally finding the natives fierce and hostile. On the 31st of October
they came to a broad river pouring into the Gulf such a volume of
water that it freshened the brine so that they were able to drink it; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the current was too much for their clumsy craft. The boat commanded by
Narvaez was lost, and never heard of; that containing Father Xuarez and
the other friars was driven ashore bottom upward; the three remaining
boats were thrown on the coast of western Louisiana or eastern Texas.
The crews barely escaped with life, and found themselves at the mercy of
cruel and treacherous savages, who lived on or near Malhado Island, and
drew a precarious living from shellfish and minor animals, prickly-pears
and the like. They were consequently not as far west as the bison range,
which reached the coast certainly at Matagorda Bay.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> Here several of the
wretched Spaniards fell victims to the cruelty of the Indians or to disease
and starvation, till Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, the treasurer of the expedition,
escaping from six years’ captivity among the Mariames, reached the
Avavares, farther inland, with two companions, Castillo and Dorantes, and
a negro slave. After spending eight months with them, he penetrated to
the Arbadaos, where the mesquite is first found, near the Rio Grande;
and skirting the San Saba Mountains, came to the bison plains and the
hunter nations; then keeping westward through tribes that lived in houses
of earth and knew the use of cotton and mined the turquoise, he finally
came upon some Spanish explorers on the River Petatlan; and thus on the
1st of April, 1536, with hearts full of joy and gratitude, the four men
entered the town of San Miguel in Sinaloa.</p>

<p>The vessels of Narvaez, not finding the alleged port of the pilots,
returned to the harbor where they had landed him, and were there joined
by the two vessels from Cuba; but though they remained nearly a year,
cruising along the coast of the Gulf, they never encountered the slightest
trace of the unfortunate Narvaez or his wretched followers. They added
nothing apparently to the knowledge of the coast already acquired; for no
report is extant, and no map alludes to any discovery by them.</p>

<p>Thus ended an expedition undertaken with rashness and ignorance, and
memorable only from the almost marvellous adventures of Cabeza de Vaca
and his comrades, and the expeditions by land which were prompted by
his narrative.</p>

<p class="p2">The wealth of Mexico and Peru had inflamed the imagination of Spanish
adventurers; and though no tidings had been received of Narvaez,
others were ready to risk all they had, and life itself, in the hope of finding
some wealthy province in the heart of the northern continent. The next
to try his fortune was one who had played his part in the conquest of
Peru.</p>

<p>Hernando de Soto, the son of an esquire of Xerez de Badajoz, was
eager to rival Cortés and Pizarro. In 1537 he solicited a grant of the
province from Rio de las Palmas to Florida, as ceded to Narvaez, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of the province discovered by Ayllon; and the King at Valladolid, on the
20th of April, issued a concession to him, appointing him to the government
of the Island of Cuba, and requiring him in person to conquer and occupy
Florida within a year, erect fortresses, and carry over at least five hundred
men as settlers to hold the country. The division of the gold, pearls, and
other valuables of the conquered caciques was regulated, and provision
made for the maintenance of the Christian religion and of an hospital in
the territory.</p>

<p>The air of mystery assumed by Cabeza de Vaca as to the countries
that he had seen, served to inflame the imagination of men in Spain;
and Soto found many ready to give their persons and their means to
his expedition. Nobles of Castile in rich slashed silk dresses mingled
with old warriors in well-tried coats of mail. He sailed from San Lucar
in April, 1538, amid the fanfaron of trumpets and the roar of cannon,
with six hundred as high-born and well-trained men as ever went forth
from Spain to win fame and fortune in the New World. They reached
Cuba safely, and Soto was received with all honor. More prudent than
Narvaez, Soto twice despatched Juan de Añasco, in a caravel with two
pinnaces, to seek a suitable harbor for the fleet, before trusting all the
vessels on the coast.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>Encouraged by the reports of this reconnoitring, Soto, leaving his wife
in Cuba, sailed from Havana in May, 1539, and made a bay on the Florida
coast ten leagues west of the Bay of Juan Ponce. To this he gave the
name of Espiritu Santo, because he reached it on the Feast of Pentecost,
which fell that year on the 25th of May.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> On the 30th he began to land
his army near a town ruled by a chief named Uçita. Soto’s whole force was
composed of five hundred and seventy men, and two hundred and twenty-three
horses, in five ships, two caravels, and two pinnaces. He took formal
possession of the country in the name of the King of Spain on the 3d of
June, and prepared to explore and subject the wealthy realms which he
supposed to lie before him. Though the chief at his landing-place was
friendly, he found that all the surrounding tribes were so hostile that they
began to attack those who welcomed him.</p>

<p>Ortiz, a Spaniard belonging to Narvaez’ expedition, who in his long years
of captivity had become as naked and as savage as were the Indians, soon
joined Soto.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> He was joyfully received; though his knowledge of the country
was limited, his services were of vital necessity, for the Indians secured
by Añasco, and on whom Soto relied as guides and interpreters, deserted at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Soto had been trained in a bad school; he had no respect for the lives
or rights of the Indians. As Oviedo, a man of experience among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
<i>conquistadores</i>, says: “This governor was very fond of this sport of killing
Indians.”<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>The plan of his march showed his disregard of the rights of the
natives. At each place he demanded of the cacique, or head chief, corn
for his men and horses, and Indians of both sexes to carry his baggage
and do the menial work in his camp. After obtaining these supplies, he
compelled the chief to accompany his army till he reached another tribe
whose chief he could treat in the same way; but though the first chief was
then released, few of the people of the tribe which he ruled, and who had
been carried off by Soto, were so fortunate as ever to be allowed to return
to their homes.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July Soto, sending back his largest ships to Cuba, moved
to the northeast to make his toilsome way amid the lakes and streams and
everglades of Florida. Before long his soldiers began to suffer from
hunger, and were glad to eat water-cresses, shoots of Indian corn, and palmetto,
in order to sustain life; for native villages were few and scattered, and
afforded little corn for the plunderers. The natives were met only as foe-men,
harassing his march. At Caliquen the Indians, to rescue their chief,
whom Soto was carrying to the next town, made a furious onslaught
on the Spaniards; but were driven to the swamps, and nearly all killed
or taken. Their dauntless spirit was, however, unbroken. The survivors,
though chained as slaves, rose on their masters; and seizing any weapon
within their reach, fought desperately, one of them endeavoring to throttle
Soto himself. Two hundred survived this gallant attempt, only to be
slaughtered by the Indian allies of the Spanish commander. Soto fought
his way westward step by step so slowly that at the end of three months,
Oct. 30, 1539, he had only reached Agile,&mdash;a town in the province of
Apalache. Añasco, sent out from this point to explore, discovered the
port where Narvaez had embarked,&mdash;the remains of his forges and the
bones of his horses attesting the fact. Soto despatched him to Tampa Bay.
Añasco with a party marched the distance in ten days; and sending two
caravels to Cuba, brought to Soto in the remaining vessels the detachment
left at his landing-place. Before he reached his commander the Indians
had burned the town of Anaica Apalache, of which Soto had taken
possession.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>A good port, that of Pensacola, had been discovered to the westward;
but Soto, crediting an Indian tale of the rich realm of Yupaha in the northeast,
left his winter quarters March 3, 1540, and advanced in that direction
through tribes showing greater civilization. A month later he reached
the Altamaha, receiving from the more friendly natives corn and game.
This was not sufficient to save the Spaniards from much suffering, and they
treated the Indians with their wonted cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Soto, after a march of four hundred and thirty leagues, much of
it through uninhabited land, reached the province ruled by the chieftainess
of Cofitachiqui. On the 1st of May she went forth to meet the Spanish
explorer in a palanquin or litter; and crossing the river in a canopied
canoe, she approached Soto, and after presenting him the gifts of shawls
and skins brought by her retinue, she took off her necklace of pearls and
placed it around the neck of Soto. Yet her courtesy and generosity
did not save her from soon being led about on foot as a prisoner. The
country around her chief town, which Jones identifies with Silver Bluff,
on the Savannah, below Augusta,<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> tempted the followers of Soto, who
wished to settle there, as from it Cuba could be readily reached. But the
commander would attempt no settlement till he had discovered some rich
kingdom that would rival Peru; and chagrined at his failure, refused even
to send tidings of his operations to Cuba. At Silver Bluff he came upon
traces of an earlier Spanish march. A dirk and a rosary were brought to
him, which were supposed, on good grounds, to have come from the
expedition of Ayllon.</p>

<p>Poring over the cosmography of Alonzo de Chaves, Soto and the officers
of his expedition concluded that a river, crossed on the 26th of May, was
the Espiritu Santo, or Mississippi. A seven days’ march, still in the chieftainess’s
realm, brought them to Chelaque, the country of the Cherokees,
poor in maize; then, over mountain ridges, a northerly march brought them
to Xualla, two hundred and fifty leagues from Silver Bluff. At the close of
May they were in Guaxule, where the chieftainess regained her freedom. It
was a town of three hundred houses, near the mountains, in a well-watered and
pleasant land, probably at the site of Coosawattie Old Town. The chief gave
Soto maize, and also three hundred dogs for the maintenance of his men.</p>

<p>Marching onward, Soto next came to Canasagua, in all probability on a
river even now called the Connasauga, flowing through an attractive land of
mulberries, persimmons, and walnuts. Here they found stores of bear oil
and walnut oil and honey. Marching down this stream and the Oostanaula,
into which it flows, to Chiaha, on an island opposite the mouth of the Etowa,
in the district of the pearl-bearing mussel-streams, Soto was received in
amity; and the cacique had some of the shellfish taken and pearls extracted
in the presence of his guest. The Spaniards encamped under the trees near
the town, leaving the inhabitants in quiet possession of their homes. Here,
on the spot apparently now occupied by Rome, they rested for a month.
A detachment sent to discover a reputed gold-producing province returned
with no tidings to encourage the adventurers; and on the 28th of June
Soto, with his men and steeds refreshed, resumed his march, having obtained
men to bear his baggage, though his demand of thirty women as slaves
was refused.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Chisca, to which he sent two men to explore for gold, proved to be in
a rugged mountain land; and the buffalo robe which they brought back
was more curious than encouraging. Soto therefore left the territory of
the Cherokees, and took the direction of Coça, probably on the Coosa
river. The cacique of that place, warned doubtless by the rumors which
must have spread through all the land of the danger of thwarting the fierce
strangers, furnished supplies at several points on the route to his town, and
as Soto approached it, came out on a litter attired in a fur robe and plumed
headpiece to make a full surrender. The Spaniards occupied the town and
took possession of all the Indian stores of corn and beans, the neighboring
woods adding persimmons and grapes. This town was one hundred and
ninety leagues west of Xualla, and lay on the east bank of the Coosa, between
the mouths of the Talladega and Tallasehatchee, as Pickett, the historian
of Alabama, determines. Soto held the chief of Coça virtually as a
prisoner; but when he demanded porters to bear the baggage of his men,
most of the Indians fled. The Spanish commander then seized every
Indian he could find, and put him in irons.</p>

<p>After remaining at Coça for twenty-five days, Soto marched to Ullibahali,
a strongly palisaded town, situated, as we may conjecture, on Hatchet
Creek. This place submitted, giving men as porters and women as slaves.
Leaving this town on the 2d of September, he marched to Tallise, in a
land teeming with corn, whose people proved equally docile.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> This submission
was perhaps only to gain time, and draw the invaders into a disadvantageous
position.</p>

<p>Actahachi, the gigantic chief of Tastaluza, sixty leagues south of Coça,
which was Soto’s next station, received him with a pomp such as the Spaniards
had not yet witnessed. The cacique was seated on cushions on a
raised platform, with his chiefs in a circle around him; an umbrella of
buckskin, stained red and white, was held over him. The curveting steeds
and the armor of the Spaniards raised no look of curiosity on his stern
countenance, and he calmly awaited Soto’s approach. Not till he found
himself detained as a prisoner would he promise to furnish the Spaniards
with porters and supplies of provisions at Mauila<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> to enable Soto to continue
his march. He then sent orders to his vassal, the chief of Mauila, to have
them in readiness.</p>

<p>As the Spaniards, accompanied by Actahachi, descended the Alabama,
passing by the strong town of Piache, the cacique of Mauila came to meet
them with friendly greetings, attended by a number of his subjects playing
upon their native musical instruments, and proffering fur robes and service;
but the demeanor of the people was so haughty that Luis de Moscoso urged
Soto not to enter the town. The <i>adelantado</i> persisted; and riding in with
seven or eight of his guard and four horsemen, sat down with the cacique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and the chief of Tastaluza, whom, according to custom, he had brought to
this place. The latter asked leave to return to his own town; when Soto
refused, he rose, pretending a wish to confer with some chiefs, and entered
a house where some armed Indians were concealed. He refused to come
out when summoned; and a chief who was ordered to carry a message to
the cacique, but refused, was cut down by Gallego with a sword. Then the
Indians, pouring out from the houses, sent volleys of arrows at Soto and his
party. Soto ran toward his men, but fell two or three times; and though
he reached his main force, five of his men were killed, and he himself, as
well as all the rest, was severely wounded. The chained Indian porters,
who bore the baggage and treasures of Soto’s force, had set down their
loads just outside the palisade. When the party of Soto had been driven
out, the men of Mauila sent all these into the town, took off their fetters,
and gave them weapons. Some of the military equipments of the Spaniards
fell into the hands of the Indians, and several of Soto’s followers, who had
like him entered the town, among them a friar and an ecclesiastic, remained
as prisoners.</p>

<p>The Indians, sending off their caciques, and apparently their women,
prepared to defend the town; but Soto, arranging his military array into
four detachments, surrounded it, and made an assault on the gates, where the
natives gathered to withstand them. By feigning flight Soto drew them out;
and by a sudden charge routed them, and gaining an entrance for his men,
set fire to the houses. This was not effected without loss, as the Spaniards
were several times repulsed by the Indians. When they at last fought their
way into the town, the Indians endeavored to escape. Finding that impossible,
as the gates were held, the men of Mauila fought desperately, and died
by the sword, or plunged into the blazing houses to perish there.</p>

<p>The battle of Mauila was one of the bloodiest ever fought on our soil
between white and red men in the earlier days. The <i>Adelantado</i> had
twenty of his men killed, and one hundred and fifty wounded; of his
horses twelve were killed and seventy wounded. The Indian loss was
estimated by the Portuguese chronicler of the expedition at twenty-five
hundred, and by Rangel at three thousand. At nightfall Biedma tells us
that only three Indians remained alive, two of whom were killed fighting;
the last hung himself from a tree in the palisade with his bowstring.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> The
Gentleman of Elvas states Soto’s whole loss up to his leaving Mauila to
have been one hundred and two by disease, accident, and Indian fighting.
Divine worship had been apparently offered in the camp regularly up to
this time; but in the flames of Mauila perished all the chalices and vestments
of the clergy, as well as the bread-irons and their store of wheat-flour
and wine, so that Mass ceased from this time.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Soto here ascertained that Francisco Maldonado was with vessels at the
port of Ichuse (or Ochuse) only six days’ march from him, awaiting
his orders. He was too proud to return to Cuba with his force reduced
in numbers, without their baggage, or any trophy from the lands he had
visited. He would not even send any tidings to Cuba, but concealed
from his men the knowledge which had been brought to him by Ortiz,
the rescued follower of Narvaez.</p>

<p>Stubborn in his pride, Soto, on the 14th of November, marched northward;
and traversing the land of Pafallaya (now Clarke, Marengo, and Greene
counties), passed the town of Taliepatua and reached Cabusto, identified
by Pickett with the site of the modern town of Erie, on the Black Warrior.
Here a series of battles with the natives occurred; but Soto fought his way
through hostile tribes to the little town of Chicaça, with its two hundred
houses clustered on a hill, probably on the western bank of the Yazoo, which
he reached in a snow-storm on the 17th of December. The cacique Miculasa
received Soto graciously, and the Spanish commander won him by
sending part of his force to attack Sacchuma, a hostile town. Having thus
propitiated this powerful chief, Soto remained here till March; when, being
ready to advance on his expedition in search of some wealthy province, he
demanded porters of the cacique. The wily chief amused the invader with
promises for several days, and then suddenly attacked the town from four
sides, at a very early hour in the morning, dashing into the place and setting
fire to the houses. The Spaniards, taken by surprise, were assailed as
they came out to put on their armor and mount their horses. Soto and one
other alone succeeded in getting into the saddle; but Soto himself, after
killing one Indian with his spear, was thrown, his girths giving way.</p>

<p>The Indians drew off with the loss of this one man, having killed eleven
Spaniards, many of their horses, and having greatly reduced their herd of
swine. In the conflagration of the town, Soto’s force lost most of their
remaining clothing, with many of their weapons and saddles. They at
once set to work to supply the loss. The woods gave ash to make saddles
and lances; forges were set up to temper the swords and make such
arms as they could; while the tall grass was woven into mats to serve as
blankets or cloaks.</p>

<p>They needed their arms indeed; for on the 15th of March the enemy,
in three divisions, advanced to attack the camp. Soto met them with as
many squadrons, and routed them with loss.</p>

<p>When Soto at last took up his march on the 25th of April, the sturdy
Alibamo, or Alimamu, or Limamu, barred his way with a palisade manned
by the painted warriors of the tribe. Soto carried it at the cost of the
lives of seven or eight of his men, and twenty-five or six wounded; only
to find that the Indians had made the palisade not to protect any stores,
but simply to cope with the invaders.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>At Quizquiz, or Quizqui, near the banks of the Mississippi, Soto surprised
the place and captured all the women; but released them to obtain
canoes to cross the river. As the Indians failed to keep their promise, Soto
encamped in a plain and spent nearly a month building four large boats,
each capable of carrying sixty or seventy men and five or six horses. The
opposite shore was held by hostile Indians; and bands of finely formed
warriors constantly came down in canoes, as if ready to engage them, but
always drawing off.</p>

<p>The Spaniards finally crossed the river at the lowest Chickasaw Bluff,
all wondering at the mighty turbid stream, with its fish, strange to
their eyes, and the trees, uprooted on the banks far above, that came
floating down.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> Soto marched northward to Little Prairie in quest of
Pacaha and Chisca, provinces reported to abound in gold. After planting
a cross on St. John’s Day<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> at Casqui, where the bisons’ heads above
the entrances to the huts reminded them of Spain, he entered Pacaha
June 29, as Oviedo says. These towns were the best they had seen
since they left Cofitachiqui. Pacaha furnished them with a booty which
they prized highly,&mdash;a fine store of skins of animals, and native blankets
woven probably of bark. These enabled the men to make clothing,
of which many had long been in sore want. The people gradually
returned, and the cacique received Soto in friendly guise, giving him
his two sisters as wives.</p>

<p>While the army rested here nearly a month, expeditions were sent in
various directions. One, marching eight days to the northwest through a
land of swamps and ponds, reached the prairies, the land of Caluça, where
Indians lived in portable houses of mats, with frames so light that a man
could easily carry them.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>Despairing of finding his long-sought El Dorado in that direction, Soto
marched south and then southwest, in all a hundred and ten leagues, to
Quiguate, a town on a branch of the Mississippi. It was the largest they
had yet seen. The Indians abandoned it; but one half the houses were
sufficient to shelter the whole of Soto’s force.</p>

<p>On the first of September the expedition reached Coligua,&mdash;a populous
town in a valley among the mountains, near which vast herds of bison roamed.
Then crossing the river again,<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Soto’s jaded and decreasing force marched
onward. Cayas, with its salt river and fertile maize-lands, was reached; and
then the Spaniards came to Tulla, where the Indians attacked them, fighting
from their housetops to the last. The cacique at last yielded, and came weeping
with great sobs to make his submission.</p>

<p>Marching southeast, Soto reached Quipana; and crossing the mountains
eastward, wintered in the province of Viranque, or Autiamque, or Utianque,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on a branch of the Mississippi, apparently the Washita.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> The sufferings
of the Spaniards during a long and severe winter were terrible, and Ortiz,
their interpreter, succumbed to his hardships and died. Even the proud
spirit of Soto yielded to his disappointments and toil. Two hundred and
fifty of his splendid force had left their bones to whiten along the path
which he had followed. He determined at last to push to the shores of the
Gulf, and there build two brigantines, in order to send to Cuba and to New
Spain for aid.</p>

<p>Passing through Ayays and the well-peopled land of Nilco, Soto went
with the cacique of Guachoyanque to his well-palisaded town on the banks
of the Mississippi, at the mouth of the Red River, arriving there on Sunday,
April 17, 1542. Here he fell ill of the fever; difficulties beset him on every
side, and he sank under the strain. Appointing Luis de Moscoço as his successor
in command, he died on the 21st of May. The <i>Adelantado</i> of Cuba
and Florida, who had hoped to gather the wealth of nations, left as his
property five Indian slaves, three horses, and a herd of swine. His
body, kept for some days in a house, was interred in the town; but as fears
were entertained that the Indians might dig up the corpse, it was taken,
wrapped in blankets loaded with sand, and sunk in the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>Muscoço’s first plan was to march westward to Mexico. But after advancing
to the province of Xacatin, the survivors of the expedition lost all
hope; and returning to the Mississippi, wintered on its banks. There
building two large boats, they embarked in them and in canoes. Hostile
Indians pursued them, and twelve men were drowned, their canoes being
run down by the enemy’s <i>periaguas</i>. The survivors reached the Gulf and
coasted along to Pánuco.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>The expedition of Soto added very little to the knowledge of the continent,
as no steps were taken to note the topography of the country or the
language of the various tribes. Diego Maldonado and Gomez Arias, seeking
Soto, explored the coast from the vicinity of the Mississippi nearly to
Newfoundland; but their reports are unknown.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the disastrous result of Soto’s expedition, and the
conclusive proof it afforded that the country bordering on the Gulf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Mexico contained no rich kingdom and afforded little inducement for
settlements, other commanders were ready to undertake the conquest of
Florida. Among these was Don Antonio
de Mendoza, the viceroy of New Spain,
who sought, by offers of rank and honors,
to enlist some of the survivors of Soto’s
march in a new campaign. In a more
mercantile spirit, Julian de Samano and
Pedro de Ahumada applied to the Spanish
monarch for a patent, promising to make
a good use of the privileges granted them,
and to treat the Indians well. They hoped to buy furs and pearls, and
carry on a trade in them till mines of gold and silver were found. The
Court, however, refused to permit the grant.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>Yet as a matter of policy it became necessary for Spain to occupy
Florida. This the Court felt; and when Cartier was preparing for his
voyage to the northern part of the continent,<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Spanish spies followed his
movements and reported all to their Government. In Spain it was decided
that Cartier’s occupation of the frozen land, for which he was equipping his
vessels, could not in any way militate against the interests of the Catholic
monarch; but it was decided that any settlement attempted in Florida
must on some pretext be crushed out.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> Florida from its position afforded
a basis for assailing the fleets which bore from Vera Cruz the treasures of
the Indies; and the hurricanes of the tropics had already strewn the Florida
coast with the fragments of Spanish wrecks. In 1545 a vessel laden with
silver and precious commodities perished on that coast, and two hundred
persons reached land, only to fall by the hands of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The next Spanish attempt to occupy Florida was not unmixed with romance;
and its tragic close invests it with peculiar interest. The Dominicans,
led by Father Antonio de Montesinos and Las Casas,&mdash;who had by this
time become Bishop of Chiapa,&mdash;were active in condemning the cruelties
of their countrymen to the natives of the New World; and the atrocities
perpetrated by Soto in his disastrous march gave new themes for their
indignant denunciations.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>One Dominican went further. Father Luis Cancer de Barbastro, when
the Indians of a province had so steadily defied the Spaniards and prevented
their entrance that it was styled “Tierra de Guerra,” succeeded by mild
and gentle means in winning the whole Indian population, so that the
province obtained the name of “Vera Paz,” or True Peace. In 1546 this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
energetic man conceived the idea of attempting the peaceful conquest of
Florida. Father Gregory de Beteta and other influential members of his
Order seconded his views. The next year he went to Spain and laid his
project before the Court, where it was favorably received. He returned
to Mexico with a royal order that all Floridians held in slavery, carried
thither by the survivors of Soto’s expedition, should be confided to Father
Cancer to be taken back to their own land. The order proved ineffectual.
Father Cancer then sailed from Vera Cruz in 1549 in the “Santa Maria del
Enzina,” without arms or soldiers, taking Father Beteta, Father Diego de
Tolosa, Father John Garcia, and others to conduct the mission. At Havana
he obtained Magdalen, a woman who had been brought from Florida, and
who had become a Christian. The vessel then steered for Florida, and
reaching the coast, at about 28°, on the eve of Ascension Day, ran northward,
but soon sailed back. The missionaries and their interpreter landed,
and found some of the Indians fishing, who proved friendly. Father Diego,
a mission coadjutor, and a sailor, resolved to remain with the natives, and
went off to their cabins. Cancer and his companions awaited their return;
but they never appeared again. For some days the Spaniards on the ship
endeavored to enter into friendly relations with the Indians, and on Corpus
Christi Fathers Cancer and Garcia landed and said Mass on shore. At last
a Spaniard named John Muñoz, who had been a prisoner among the Indians,
managed to reach the ship; and from him they learned that the missionary
and his companions had been killed by the treacherous natives almost immediately
after reaching their cabins. He had not witnessed their murder,
but declared that he had seen the missionary’s scalp. Magdalen, however,
came to the shore and assured the missionaries that their comrade was alive
and well.</p>

<p>It had thus become a serious matter what course to pursue. The vessel
was too heavy to enter the shallow bays, the provisions were nearly exhausted,
water could not be had, and the ship’s people were clamoring to
return to Mexico. The missionaries, all except Father Cancer, desired to
abandon the projected settlement, but he still believed that by presents and
kindness to the Indians he could safely remain. His companions in vain
endeavored to dissuade him. On Tuesday, June 25, he was pulled in a boat
near the shore. He leaped into the water and waded towards the land.
Though urged to return, he persevered. Kneeling for a few minutes on the
beach, he advanced till he met the Indians. The sailors in the boat saw
one Indian pull off his hat, and another strike him down with a club. One
cry escaped his lips. A crowd of Indians streamed down to the shore and
with arrows drove off the boat. Lingering for awhile, the vessel sailed back
to Vera Cruz, after five lives had thus rashly been sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>On the arrival of the tidings of this tragic close of Cancer’s mission a
congress was convened by Maximilian, King of Bohemia, then regent in
Spain; and the advocates of the peace policy in regard to the Indians lost
much of the influence which they had obtained in the royal councils.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>The wreck of the fleet, with rich cargoes of silver, gold, and other
precious commodities, on the northern shore of the Gulf of Mexico in 1553,
when several hundred persons perished, and the sufferings of the surviving
passengers, among whom were several Dominicans, in their attempt to reach
the settlements; and the wreck of Farfan’s fleet on the Atlantic coast near
Santa Elena in December, 1554,&mdash;showed the necessity of having posts on
that dangerous coast of Florida, in order to save life and treasure.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>The Council of the Indies advised Philip II. to confide the conquest and
settlement of Florida to Don Luis de Velasco, viceroy of New Spain, who
was anxious to undertake the task. The Catholic monarch had previously
rejected the projects of Zurita and Samano; but the high character of
Velasco induced him to confide the task to the viceroy of Mexico. The
step was a gain for the humanitarian party; and the King, on giving his
approval, directed that Dominican friars should be selected to accompany
the colonists, in order to minister to them and convert the Indians. Don
Luis de Velasco had directed the government in Mexico since November,
1550, with remarkable prudence and ability. The natives found in him
such an earnest, capable, and unwavering protector that he is styled in
history the Father of the Indians.</p>

<p>The plans adopted by this excellent governor for the occupation of
Florida were in full harmony with the Dominican views. In the treatment
of the Indians he anticipated the just and equitable methods which give
Calvert, Williams, and Penn so enviable a place in American annals.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>The occupation was not to be one of conquest, and all intercourse with
the Indians was to be on the basis of natural equity. His first step was
prompted by his characteristic prudence.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> In September, 1558, he despatched
Guido de Labazares, with three vessels and a sufficient force, to
explore the whole Florida coast, and select the best port he found for the
projected settlement. Labazares, on his return after an investigation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
several months, reported in favor of Pensacola Bay, which he named Felipina;
and he describes its entrance between a long island and a point
of land. The country was well wooded, game and fish abounded, and
the Indian fields showed that Indian corn and vegetables could be raised
successfully.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> On the return of Labazares in December, preparations were
made for the expedition, which was placed under the command of Don
Tristan de Luna y Arellano. The force consisted of fifteen hundred soldiers
and settlers, under six captains of cavalry and six of infantry, some of whom
had been at Coça, and were consequently well acquainted with the country
where it was intended to form the settlement. The Dominicans selected
were Fathers Pedro de Feria, as vicar-provincial of Florida, Dominic of
the Annunciation, Dominic de Salazar, John Maçuelas, Dominic of Saint
Dominic, and a lay brother. The object being to settle, provisions for a
whole year were prepared, and ammunition to meet all their wants.</p>

<p>The colonists, thus well fitted for their undertaking, sailed from Vera
Cruz on the 11th of June, 1559; and by the first of the following month
were off the bay in Florida to which Miruelo had given his name. Although
Labazares had recommended Pensacola Bay, Tristan de Luna seems to have
been induced by his pilots to give the preference to the Bay of Ichuse; and
he sailed west in search of it, but passed it, and entered Pensacola Bay.
Finding that he had gone too far, Luna sailed back ten leagues east to
Ichuse, which must have been Santa Rosa Bay. Here he anchored his
fleet, and despatched the factor Luis Daza, with a galleon, to Vera Cruz to
announce his safe arrival. He fitted two other vessels to proceed to Spain,
awaiting the return of two exploring parties; he then prepared to land his
colonists and stores.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Meanwhile he sent a detachment of one hundred men
under captains Alvaro Nyeto and Gonzalo Sanchez, accompanied by one of
the missionaries, to explore the country and ascertain the disposition of the
Indians. The exploring parties returned after three weeks, having found
only one hamlet, in the midst of an uninhabited country.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> Before Luna
had unloaded his vessels, they were struck, during the night of September
19,<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> by a terrible hurricane, which lasted twenty-four hours, destroying five
ships, a galleon and a bark, and carrying one caravel and its cargo into a
grove some distance on land. Many of the people perished, and most of
the stores intended for the maintenance of the colony were ruined or lost.</p>

<p>The river, entering the Bay of Ichuse, proved to be very difficult of
navigation, and it watered a sparsely-peopled country. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
detachment,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> sent apparently to the northwest, after a forty days’ march through
uncultivated country, reached a large river, apparently the Escambia, and
followed its banks to Nanipacna, a deserted town of eighty houses. Explorations
in various directions found no other signs of Indian occupation.
The natives at last returned and became friendly.</p>

<p>Finding his original site unfavorable, Tristan de Luna, after exhausting
the relief-supplies sent him, and being himself prostrated by a fever in which
he became delirious, left Juan de Jaramillo at the port with fifty men and
negro slaves, and proceeded<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> with the rest of his company, nearly a thousand
souls, to Nanipacna, some by land, and some ascending the river in
their lighter craft. To this town he gave the name of Santa Cruz. The
stores of Indian corn, beans, and other vegetables left by the Indians were
soon consumed by the Spaniards, who were forced to live on acorns or any
herbs they could gather.</p>

<p>The Viceroy, on hearing of their sufferings, sent two vessels to their relief
in November, promising more ample aid in the spring. The provisions
they obtained saved them from starvation during the winter, but in the
spring their condition became as desperate as ever. No attempt seems
to have been made to cultivate the Indian fields, or to raise anything for
their own support.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>In hope of obtaining provisions from Coça, Jaramillo sent his sergeant-major
with six captains and two hundred soldiers, accompanied by Father
Dominic de Salazar and Dominic of the Annunciation, to that province.
On the march the men were forced to eat straps, harnesses, and the leather
coverings of their shields; some died of starvation, while others were poisoned
by herbs which they ate. A chestnut wood proved a godsend, and a
fifty days’ march brought them to Olibahali (Hatchet Creek), where the
friendly natives ministered to their wants.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>About the beginning of July they reached Coça, on the Coosa River, then
a town of thirty houses, near which were seven other towns of the same
tribe. Entering into friendly intercourse with these Indians, the Spaniards
obtained food for themselves and their jaded horses. After resting here
for three months, the Spaniards, to gain the good-will of the Coosas, agreed
to aid them in a campaign against the Napochies,&mdash;a nation near the
Ochechiton,<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> the Espiritu Santo, or Mississippi. These were in all probability
the Natchez. The Coosas and their Spanish allies defeated this tribe,
and compelled them to pay tribute, as of old, to the Coosas. Their town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
saved with difficulty from the flames, gave the Spaniards a supply of corn.
On their return to Coça, the sergeant-major sent to report to Tristan de
Luna; but his messengers found no Spaniard at Nanipacna, save one hanging
from a tree. Tristan de Luna, supposing his men lost, had gone down
to Ochuse Bay, leaving directions on a tree, and a buried letter.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Father
Feria and some others had sailed for Havana, and all were eager to leave
the country.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> Tristan de Luna was reluctant to abandon the projected settlement,
and wished to proceed to Coça with all the survivors of his force.
His sickness had left him so capricious and severe, that he seemed actually
insane. The supplies promised in the spring had not arrived in September,
though four ships left Vera Cruz toward the end of June. Parties sent out
by land and water found the fields on the Escambia and Mobile<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> forsaken
by the Indians, who had laid waste their towns and removed their provisions.
In this desperate state George Ceron, the <i>maestro de campo</i>, opposed the
Governor’s plan,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> and a large part of the force rallied around him. When
Tristan de Luna issued a proclamation ordering the march, there was an
open mutiny, and the Governor condemned the whole of the insurgents to
death. Of course he could not attempt to execute so many, but he did
hang one who deserted. The mutineers secretly sent word to Coça, and
in November the party from that province with the two missionaries arrived
at Pensacola Bay.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> Don Tristan’s detachment was also recalled from the original
landing, and the whole force united. The dissensions continued till
the missionaries, amid the solemnities of Holy Week, by appealing to the
religious feelings of the commander and Ceron, effected a reconciliation.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>At this juncture Angel de Villafañe’s fleet entered the harbor of Ichuse.
He announced to the people that he was on his way to Santa Elena, which
Tristan de Luna had made an ineffectual effort to reach. All who chose
were at liberty to accompany him. The desire to evacuate the country
where they had suffered so severely was universal. None expressed a wish
to remain; and Tristan de Luna, seeing himself utterly abandoned, embarked
for Havana with a few servants. Villafañe then took on board all except a
detachment of fifty or sixty men who were left at Ichuse under Captain
Biedma, with orders to remain five or six months; at the expiration of
which time they were to sail away also, in case no instructions came.</p>

<p>Villafañe, with the “San Juan” and three other vessels and about two
hundred men, put into Havana; but there many of the men deserted,
and several officers refused to proceed.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>With Gonzalo Gayon as pilot, Villafañe reached Santa Elena&mdash;now Port
Royal Sound&mdash;May 27, 1561, and took possession in the name of the King
of Spain. Finding no soil adapted for cultivation, and no port suitable for
planting a settlement, he kept along the coast, doubled Cape Roman, and
landing on the 2d of June, went inland till he reached the Santee, where he
again took formal possession. On the 8th he was near the Jordan or Pedee;
but a storm drove off one of his vessels. With the rest he continued his
survey of the coast till he doubled Cape Hatteras. There, on the 14th of
June, his caravel well-nigh foundered, and his two smaller vessels undoubtedly
perished. He is said to have abandoned the exploration of the coast
here, although apparently it was his vessel, with the Dominican Fathers,
which about this time visited Axacan, on the Chesapeake, and took off a
brother of the chief.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

<p>Villafañe then sailed to Santo Domingo, and Florida was abandoned.
In fact, on the 23d of September the King declared that no further attempt
was to be made to colonize that country, either in the Gulf or at Santa
Elena, alleging that there was no ground to fear that the French would set
foot in that land or take possession of it; and the royal order cites the
opinion of Pedro Menendez against any attempt to form settlements on
either coast.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<p>As if to show the fallacy of their judgment and their forecast, the French
(and what was worse, from the Spanish point of view, French Calvinists)
in the next year, under Ribault, took possession of Port Royal,&mdash;the very
Santa Elena which Villafañe considered unfitted for colonization. Here
they founded Charlesfort and a settlement, entering Port Royal less than
three months after the Spanish officers convened in Mexico had united in
condemning the country.</p>

<p>Pedro Menendez de Aviles had, as we have seen, been general of the
fleet to New Spain in 1560, and on his return received instructions to
examine the Atlantic coast north of the very spot where the French thus
soon after settled. In 1561 he again commanded the fleet; but on his
homeward voyage a terrible storm scattered the vessels near the Bermudas,
and one vessel, on which his only son and many of his kinsmen had
embarked, disappeared. With the rest of his ships he reached Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
filled with anxiety, eager only to fit out vessels to seek his son, who, he believed,
had been driven on the Florida coast, and was probably a prisoner
in the hands of the Indians. At this critical moment, however, charges were
brought against him; and he, with his brother, was arrested and detained in
prison for two years, unable to bring the case to trial, or to obtain his release
on bail.</p>

<p>When Menendez at last succeeded in obtaining an audience of the King,
he solicited, in 1564, permission to proceed with two vessels to Bermuda and
Florida to seek his son, and then retire to his home, which he had not seen
for eighteen years. Philip II. at last consented; but required him to make
a thorough coast-survey of Florida, so as to prepare charts that would prevent
the wrecks which had arisen from ignorance of the real character of
the sea-line. Menendez replied that his Majesty could confer no higher
boon upon him for his long and successful services on the seas than to
authorize him to conquer and settle Florida.</p>

<p>Nothing could be in greater accordance with the royal views than to
commit to the energy of Menendez<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> the task which so many others had undertaken
in vain. A patent, or <i>asiento</i>, was issued March 20, 1565, by the
provisions of which Menendez was required to sail in May with ten vessels,
carrying arms and supplies, and five hundred men, one hundred to be
capable of cultivating the soil. He was to take provisions to maintain the
whole force for a year, and was to conquer and settle Florida within three
years; explore and map the coast, transport settlers, a certain number of
whom were to be married; maintain twelve members of religious Orders as
missionaries, besides four of the Society of Jesus; and to introduce horses,
black cattle, sheep, and swine for the two or three distinct settlements
he was required to found at his own expense.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> The King gave only the
use of the galleon “San Pelayo,” and bestowed upon Menendez the title
of <i>Adelantado</i> of Florida, a personal grant of twenty-five leagues square,
with the title of Marquis, and the office of Governor and Captain-General
of Florida.</p>

<p>While Menendez was gathering, among his kindred in Asturias and
Biscay, men and means to fulfil his part of the undertaking, the Court of
Spain became aware for the first time that the Protestants of France had
quietly planted a colony on that very Florida coast. Menendez was immediately
summoned in haste to Court; and orders were issued to furnish him
in America three vessels fully equipped, and an expeditionary force of two
hundred cavalry and four hundred infantry. Menendez urged, on the contrary,
that he should be sent on at once with some light vessels to attack
the French; or, if that was not feasible, to occupy a neighboring port and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
fortify it, while awaiting reinforcements. The Government, by successive
orders, increased the Florida armament, so that Menendez finally sailed from
Cadiz, June 29, with the galleon “San Pelayo” and other vessels to the
number of nineteen, carrying more than fifteen hundred persons, including
farmers and mechanics of all kinds.</p>

<p>The light in which Spaniards, especially those connected with commerce
and colonies, regarded the Protestants of France was simply that of
pirates. French cruisers, often making their Protestantism a pretext for
their actions, scoured the seas, capturing Spanish and Portuguese vessels,
and committing the greatest atrocities. In 1555 Jacques Sorie surprised
Havana, plundered it, and gave it to the flames, butchering the prisoners
who fell into his hands. In 1559 Megander pillaged Porto Rico, and John
de la Roche plundered the ships and settlements near Carthagena.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>It seems strange, however, that neither in Spain nor in America was it
known that this dreaded and hated community, the Huguenots of France,
had actually, in 1562, begun a settlement at the very harbor of Santa Elena
where Villafañe had taken possession in the name of the Spanish monarch
a year before. Some of the French settlers revolted, and very naturally
went off to cruise against the Spaniards, and with success; but the ill-managed
colony of Charlesfort on Port Royal Sound had terminated its brief
existence without drawing down the vengeance of Spain.</p>

<p>When the tidings of a French occupancy of Florida startled the Spanish
Court, a second attempt of the Huguenots at settlement had been made,&mdash;this
time at the mouth of St. John’s River, where Fort Caroline was a direct
menace to the rich Spanish fleets, offering a safe refuge to cruisers, which in
the name of a pure gospel could sally out to plunder and to slay. Yet that
settlement, thus provoking the fiercest hostility of Spain, was ill-managed.
It was, in fact, sinking, like its predecessor, from the unfitness of its members
to make the teeming earth yield them its fruits for their maintenance.
René Laudonnière, the commandant, after receiving some temporary relief
from the English corsair Hawkins,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> and learning that the Spaniards meditated
hostilities, was about to burn his fort and abandon the country, when
John Ribault arrived as commandant, with supplies and colonists, as well as
orders to maintain the post. His instructions from Coligny clearly intended
that he should attack the Spaniards.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The two bitter antagonists, each stimulated by his superiors, were thus
racing across the Atlantic, each endeavoring to outstrip the other, so as to
be able first to assume the offensive. The struggle was to be a deadly
one, for on neither side were there any of the ordinary restraints; it was
to be a warfare without mercy.</p>

<p>After leaving the Canaries, Menendez’ fleet was scattered by storms.
One vessel put back; the flagship and another were driven in one direction,
five vessels in another. These, after encountering another storm, finally
reached Porto Rico on the 9th of August, and found the flagship and its
tender there.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>The other ships from Biscay and Asturias had not arrived; but Menendez,
fearing that Ribault might outstrip him, resolved to proceed, though his
vessels needed repairs from the injuries sustained in the storm. If he was
to crush Fort Caroline, he felt that it must be done before the French post
was reinforced; if not, all the force at his disposal would be insufficient to
assume the offensive. He made the coast of Florida near Cape Cañaveral
on the 25th of August; and soon after, by landing a party, ascertained
from the natives that the French post was to the northward. Following
the coast in that direction, he discovered, on the 28th, a harbor which
seemed to possess advantages, and to which he gave the name of the
great Bishop of Hippo, Augustine, who is honored on that day. Sailing
on cautiously, he came in sight of the mouth of the St. John’s River about
two o’clock in the afternoon of the 4th of September. The ten days he
had lost creeping along the coast were fatal to his project, for there lay
the four vessels of Ribault, the flagship and its consort flinging to the
breeze the colors of France.</p>

<p>Menendez’ officers in council were in favor of running back to Santo
Domingo till the whole force was united and ready to assume the offensive;
but Menendez inspired them with his own intrepidity, and resolved to
attack at once. A tremendous thunderstorm prevented operations till ten
at night, when he bore down on the French, and ran his ship, the “Pelayo,”
between the two larger vessels of Ribault. To his hail who they were
and what they were doing there, the reply was that John Ribault was their
captain-general, and that they came to the country by order of the King of
France; and the French in return asked what ships they were, and who
commanded them. To quote his own words, “I replied to them that I
was Peter Menendez, that I came by command of the King of Spain to
this coast and land to burn and hang the French Lutherans found in it,
and that in the morning I would board his ships to know whether he
belonged to that sect; because if he did, I could not avoid executing on
them the justice which his Majesty commanded. They replied that this
was not right, and that I might go without awaiting the morning.”</p>

<p>As Menendez manœuvred to get a favorable position, the French vessels
cut their cables and stood out to sea. The Spaniards gave chase, rapidly
firing five cannon at Ribault’s flagship,&mdash;which Menendez supposed that
he injured badly, as boats put off to the other vessels. Finding that
the French outsailed him, Menendez put back, intending to land soldiers
on an island at the mouth of the river and fortify a position which would
command the entrance; but as he reached the St. John’s he saw three
French vessels coming out, ready for action.</p>

<p>His project was thus defeated; and too wily to be caught at a disadvantage
by the returning French vessels, Menendez bore away to the
harbor of St. Augustine, which he estimated at eight leagues from the
French by sea, and six by land. Here he proceeded to found the oldest

<p>Two hundred
mail-clad soldiers, commanded by Captain John de San Vicente and
Captain Patiño, landed on the 6th of September, 1565. The Indians were
friendly, and readily gave the settlers the large house of one of the caciques
which stood near the shore of the river. Around this an intrenchment
was traced; and a ditch was soon dug, and earthworks thrown up, with
such implements as they had at hand, for the vessel bearing their tools
had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>The next day three of the smaller vessels ran into the harbor, and from
them three hundred more of the soldiers disembarked, as well as those who
had come to settle in the country,&mdash;men, women, and children. Artillery
and munitions for the fort were also landed. The eighth being a holiday

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Amid all this bustle and activity the Spaniards were startled by the appearance
of two large French vessels<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> in the offing, evidently ready for action.
It was no part of Menendez’ plan to engage them, and he waited till, about
three in the afternoon, they bore away for the St. John’s. Then he prepared
to land in person. As his boat left the vessel with banners unfurled,
amid the thunder of cannon and the sounds of warlike music,
Mendoza Grajales, the first priest of St. Augustine, bearing a cross, went
down at the head of those on shore to meet the <i>adelantado</i>, all chanting
the Te Deum. Menendez proceeded at once with his attendants to the
cross, which he kissed on bended knee.</p>

<p>Formal possession of the land was then taken in the name of Philip II.,
King of Spain. The captains of the troops and the officers of the new
colony came forward to take the oath to Peter Menendez de Aviles as
governor, captain-general, and <i>adelantado</i> of Florida and its coasts under
the patents of the Spanish King. Crowds of friendly Indians, with their
chieftains, gathered around.</p>

<p>From them the Spanish commander learned that his position was admirably
taken, as he could, at a short distance, strike the river on which the
French lay, and descend it to assail them. Here then he resolved to make
his position as strong as possible, till the rest of his armament arrived.
His galleon “San Pelayo,” too large to enter the port, rode without, in
danger from the sudden storms that visit the coast, and from the French.
Putting on board some French prisoners whom he had captured in a boat,
he despatched her and another vessel to Santo Domingo. He organized his
force by appointing officers,&mdash;a lieutenant and a sergeant-major, and ten
captains. The necessity of horses to operate rapidly induced him to send
two of his lighter vessels to Havana to seek them there; and by this
conveyance he addressed to Philip II. his first letter from Florida.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>The masts of his vessels could scarcely have vanished from the eyes
of the Spanish force, when the French vessels appeared once more, and
nearly captured Menendez himself in the harbor, where he was carrying to
the shore, in the smaller vessels that he had retained, some artillery and
munitions from the galleons. He escaped, however, though the French
were so near that they called on him to surrender. And he ascribed his
deliverance rather to prayer than to human skill; for, fierce seaman as
he was, he was a man of deep and practical religious feeling, which influenced
all his actions.</p>

<p>Menendez’ position was now one of danger. The force at his command
was not large, and the French evidently felt strong enough, and were determined
to attack him. He had acknowledged his inability to cope with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
on the ocean, and could not have felt very sanguine of being able to defend
the slight breastworks that had been thrown up at St. Augustine.</p>

<p>Fortune favored him. Ribault, after so earnestly determining to assume
the offensive, fatally hesitated. Within two days a tremendous hurricane,
which the practised eye of Menendez had anticipated, burst on the coast.
The French were, he believed, still hovering near, on the lookout for his
larger vessels, and he knew that with such a norther their peril was
extreme. It was, moreover, certain that they could not, for a time at
least, make the St. John’s, even if they rode out the storm.</p>

<p>This gave him a temporary superiority, and he resolved to seize his
opportunity. Summoning his officers to a council of war, he laid before
them his plan of marching at once to attack Fort Caroline, from which the
French had evidently drawn a part of their force, and probably their most
effective men. The officers generally, as well as the two clergymen in the
settlement, opposed his project as rash; but Menendez was determined.
Five hundred men&mdash;three hundred armed with arquebuses, the rest with
pikes and targets&mdash;were ordered to march, each one carrying rations of biscuit
and wine. Menendez, at their head, bore his load like the rest. They
marched out of the fort on the 16th of September, guided by two caciques
who had been hostile to the French, and by a Frenchman who had been two
years in the fort. The route proved one of great difficulty; the rain poured
in torrents, swelling the streams and flooding the lowlands, so that the men
were most of the time knee-deep in water. Many loitered, and, falling back,
made their way to St. Augustine. Others showed a mutinous disposition,
and loudly expressed their contempt for their sailor-general.</p>

<p>On the 29th, at the close of the day, he was within a short distance of
the French fort, and halted to rest so as to storm it in the morning. At
daybreak the Spaniards knelt in prayer; then, bearing twenty scaling-ladders,
Menendez advanced, his sturdy Asturians and Biscayans in the van. Day
broke as, in a heavy rain, they reached a height from which their French
guide told them they could see the fort, washed by the river. Menendez
advanced, and saw some houses and the St. John’s; but from his position
could not discover the fort. He would have gone farther; but the Maese
de Campo and Captain Ochoa pushed on till they reached the houses, and
reconnoitred the fort, where not a soul seemed astir. As they returned
they were hailed by a French sentinel, who took them for countrymen.
Ochoa sprang upon him, striking him on the head with his sheathed sword,
while the Maese de Campo stabbed him. He uttered a cry; but was
threatened with death, bound, and taken back. The cry had excited
Menendez, who, supposing that his officers had been killed, called out:
“Santiago! at them! God helps us! Victory! The French are slaughtered!
Don Pedro de Valdes, the Maese de Campo, is in the fort, and
has taken it!”</p>

<p>The men, supposing that the officers were in advance with part of the
force, rushed on till they came up with the returning officers, who, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
in the situation, despatched the sentry and led the men to the attack. Two
Frenchmen, who rushed out in their shirts, were cut down. Others outside
the fort seeing the danger, gave the alarm; and a man at the principal
gate threw it open to ascertain what the trouble was. Valdes, ready to
scale the fort, saw the advantage, sprang on the man and cut him down,
then rushed into the fort, followed by the fleetest of the Spanish detachment.
In a moment two captains had simultaneously planted their colors
on the walls, and the trumpets sounded for victory.</p>

<p>The French, taken utterly by surprise, made no defence; about fifty,
dashing over the walls of the fort, took to the woods, almost naked, and
unarmed, or endeavored in boats and by swimming to reach the vessels
in the stream. When Menendez came up with the main body, his
men were slaughtering the French as they ran shrieking through the
fort, or came forward declaring that they surrendered. The women, and
children under the age of fifteen, were, by orders of the commander,
spared. Laudonnière, the younger Ribault, Lemoyne, and the carpenter
Le Challeux, whose accounts have reached us, were among those who
escaped.</p>

<p>Menendez had carried the fort without one of his men being killed or
wounded. The number of the French thus unsparingly put to the sword
is stated by Menendez himself as one hundred and thirty-two, with ten of
the fugitives who were butchered the next day. Mendoza Grajales corroborates
this estimate. Fifty were spared, and about as many escaped to
the vessels; and some, doubtless, perished in the woods.</p>

<p>The slaughter was too terrible to need depicting in darker colors; but
in time it was declared that Menendez hung many, with an insulting label:
“I do not this to Frenchmen, but to Heretics.” The Spanish accounts,
written with too strong a conviction of the propriety of their course to seek
any subterfuge, make no allusion to any such act; and the earliest French
accounts are silent in regard to it. The charge first occurs in a statement
written with an evident design to rouse public indignation in France, and
not, therefore, to be deemed absolutely accurate.</p>

<p>No quarter was given, for the French were regarded as pirates; and as
the French cruisers gave none, these, who were considered as of the same
class, received none.</p>

<p>The booty acquired was great. A brigantine and a galiot fell into the
hands of the Spaniards, with a vessel that had grounded. Another vessel
lay near the fort, and Spanish accounts claim to have sunk it with the
cannon of the fort, while the French declare they scuttled it. Two other
vessels lay at the mouth of the river, watching for the Spaniards, whose
attack was expected from the sea, and not from the land side. Besides
these vessels and their contents, the Spaniards gained in the fort artillery
and small-arms, supplies of flour and bread, horses, asses, sheep, and hogs.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Such was the first struggle on our soil between civilized men; it was brief,
sanguinary, merciless.</p>

<p>Menendez named the captured fort San Mateo, from its capture on the
feast of St. Matthew (September 21). He set up the arms of Spain, and
selected a site for a church, which he ordered to be built at once. Then,
leaving Gonçalo de Villaroel in command, with a garrison of three hundred
men, he prepared to march back to St. Augustine with about one hundred,
who composed the rest of the force which had remained with him till he
reached Caroline. But of them all he found only thirty-five able or willing
to undertake the march; and with these he set out, deeming his presence
necessary at St. Augustine. Before long, one of the party pushed on to
announce his coming.</p>

<p>The Spaniards there had learned of the disaster which had befallen Ribault’s
fleet from a Frenchman who was the sole survivor of one small vessel
that had been driven ashore, its crew escaping a watery death only to perish
by the hands of the Indians. The vessel was secured and brought to St.
Augustine. The same day, September 23, a man was seen running toward
the fort, uttering loud shouts. The priest, Mendoza Grajales, ran out to
learn the tidings he bore. The soldier threw his arms around him, crying:
“Victory! Victory! the French fort is ours!” He was soon recounting
to his countrymen the story of the storming of Caroline. Toward nightfall
the <i>adelantado</i> himself, with his little party, was seen approaching.
Mendoza in surplice, bearing a crucifix, went forth to meet him. Menendez
knelt to kiss the cross, and his men imitated his example; then they
entered the fort in procession, chanting the Te Deum.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

<p>Menendez despatched some light boats with supplies to San Mateo; but
the fort there took fire a few days after its capture, and was almost entirely
destroyed, with much of the booty. He sent other light craft to Santo
Domingo with prisoners, and others still to patrol the coast and seek any
signs of the galleon “San Pelayo,” or of the French. Then he turned his
whole attention to work on his fort and town, so as to be in readiness to
withstand any attack from Ribault if the French commander should return
and prove to be in a condition to assail him while his forces were divided.
He also cultivated friendly intercourse with the neighboring chiefs whom
he found hostile to the French and their allies.</p>

<p>On the 28th, some of the Indians came to report by signs that the French
were six leagues distant, that they had lost their ships, and that they had
reached the shore by swimming. They had halted at a stream which they
could not cross,&mdash;evidently Matanzas inlet. Menendez sent out a boat,
and followed in another with some of his officers and Mendoza, one of the
clergymen. He overtook his party, and they encamped near the inlet, but
out of sight. On the opposite side, the light of the camp-fires marked the
spot occupied by the French. The next day, seeing Menendez, a sailor
swam over, and stated that he had been sent to say that they were survivors
of some of Ribault’s vessels which had been wrecked; that many of their
people had been drowned, others killed or captured by the Indians; and
that the rest, to the number of one hundred and forty, asked permission
and aid to reach their fort, some distance up the coast.</p>

<p>Menendez told
him that he had captured the fort and put all to the sword. Then, after
asking whether they were Catholics or Lutherans, and receiving the reply,
the Spaniard sent the sailor to his companions, to say that if they did not
give up their arms and surrender, he would put them all to the sword. On
this an officer came over to endeavor to secure better terms, or to be allowed
to remain till vessels could be obtained to take them to France; but Menendez
was inexorable. The officer pleaded that the lives of the French should
be spared; but Menendez, according to Mendoza, replied, “that he would
not give them such a pledge, but that they should bring their arms and
their persons, and that he should do with them according to his will;
because if he spared their lives he wished them to be grateful to him for it,
and if he put them to death they should not complain that he had broken
his word.” Solis de Meras, another clergyman, brother-in-law of Menendez,
and in St. Augustine at the time, in his account states that Menendez said,
“That if they wished to lay down their colors and their arms, and throw
themselves on his mercy, they could do so, that he might do with them what
God should give him the grace to do; or that they could do as they chose:
for other truce or friendship could not be made with him;” and that he
rejected an offer of ransom which they made.</p>

<p>Menendez himself more briefly writes: “I replied that they might
surrender me their arms and put themselves under my pleasure, that I
might do with them what our Lord might ordain; and from this resolution
I do not and will not depart, unless our Lord God inspired me otherwise.”
The words held out hopes that were delusive; but the French, hemmed
in by the sea and by savages, saw no alternative. They crossed, laid down
their arms, and were bound, by order of Menendez,&mdash;ostensibly to conduct
them to the fort. Sixteen, chiefly Breton sailors, who professed to be
Catholics, were spared; the rest, one hundred and eleven in all, were put
to death in cold blood,&mdash;as ruthlessly as the French, ten years before, had
despatched their prisoners amid the smoking ruins of Havana, and, like
them, in the name of religion.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Ribault himself, who was advancing by the same fatal route, was ignorant
alike of the fall of Caroline and of the slaughter of the survivors of the
advanced party; he too hoped to reach Laudonnière. Some days after the
cruel treatment of the first band he reached the inlet, whose name to this
day is a monument of the bloody work,&mdash;Matanzas.</p>

<p>The news of the appearance of this second French party reached
Menendez on the 10th of October,&mdash;at the same time almost as that of the
destruction of Fort San Mateo and its contents by fire, and while writing a
despatch to the King, unfolding his plan for colonizing and holding Florida,
by means of a series of forts at the Chesapeake, Port Royal, the Martyrs,
and the Bay of Juan Ponce de Leon. He marched to the inlet with one
hundred and fifty men. The French were on the opposite side, some
making a rude raft. Both parties sounded drum and trumpet, and flung
their standards to the breeze, drawing up in line of battle. Menendez then
ordered his men to sit down and breakfast. Upon this, Ribault raised a
white flag, and one of his men was soon swimming across. He returned
with an Indian canoe that lay at the shore, and took over La Caille, an
officer. Approaching Menendez, the French officer announced that the
force was that of John Ribault, viceroy for the French king, three hundred
and fifty men in all, who had been wrecked on the coast, and was now
endeavoring to reach Fort Caroline. He soon learned how vain was the
attempt. The fate of the fort and of its garrison, and the stark bodies of the
preceding party, convinced him that those whom he represented must prepare
to meet a similar fate. He requested Menendez to send an officer to Ribault
to arrange terms of surrender; but the reply was that the French commander
was free to cross with a few of his men, if he wished a conference.</p>

<p>When this was reported to him, the unfortunate Ribault made an effort
in person to save his men. He was courteously received by Menendez,
but, like his lieutenant, saw that the case was hopeless. According to Solis
de Meras, Ribault offered a ransom of one hundred and fifty thousand
ducats for himself and one part of his men; another part, embracing many
wealthy nobles, preferring to treat separately. Menendez declined the offer,
expressing his regret at being compelled to forego the money, which he
needed. His terms were as enigmatical as before. He declared, so he
himself tells us, “that they must lay down their arms and colors and put
themselves under my pleasure; that I should do with their persons as I
chose, and that there was nothing else to be done or concluded with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Ribault returned to his camp and held a council with his officers. Some
were inclined to throw themselves on the mercy of Menendez; but the
majority refused to surrender. The next morning Ribault came over with
seventy officers and men, who decided to surrender and trust to the mercy
of the merciless. The rest had turned southward, preferring to face new
perils rather than be butchered.</p>

<p>The French commander gave up the banner of France and that of
Coligny, with the colors of his force, his own fine set of armor, and his seal
of office. As he and his comrades were bound, he intoned one of the
Psalms; and after its concluding words added: “We are of earth, and to
earth we must return; twenty years more or less is all but as a tale that is
told.” Then he bade Menendez do his will. Two young nobles, and a
few men whom Menendez could make useful, he spared; the rest were at
once despatched.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a></p>

<p>The French who declined to surrender retreated unpursued to Cañaveral,
where they threw up a log fort and began to build a vessel in
order to escape from Florida. Menendez, recalling some of the men
who remained at San Mateo, set out against them with one hundred
and fifty men, three vessels following the shore with one hundred men
to support his force. On the 8th of November apparently, he reached
the fort. The French abandoned it and fled; but on promise that
their lives should be spared, one hundred and fifty surrendered. Menendez
kept his word. He destroyed their fort and vessel; and leaving
a detachment of two hundred under Captain Juan Velez de Medrano
to build Fort Santa Lucia de Cañaveral in a more favorable spot, he
sailed to Havana. Finding some of his vessels there, he cruised in
search of corsairs&mdash;chiefly French and English&mdash;who were said to be
in great force off the coast of Santo Domingo, and who had actually
captured one of his caravels; he was afraid that young Ribault might
have joined them, and that he would attack the Spanish posts in Florida.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>
But encountering a vessel, Menendez learned that the King had
sent him reinforcements, which he resolved to await, obtaining supplies
from Campechy for his forts, as the Governor of Havana refused to
furnish any.</p>

<p>The Spaniards in the three Florida posts were ill-prepared for even a
Florida winter, and one hundred died for want of proper clothing and food.
Captain San Vicente and other malcontents excited disaffection, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
mutinies broke out, and the insurgents seized vessels and deserted. Fort
San Mateo was left with only twenty-one persons in it.</p>

<p>In February, 1566, Menendez explored the Tortugas and the adjacent
coast, seeking some trace of the vessel in which his son had been lost. His
search was fruitless; but he established friendly relations with the cacique
Carlos, and rescued several Spanish prisoners from that cruel chief, who
annually sacrificed one of them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French fugitives excited the Indians who were friendly to
them to attack the Spanish posts; and it was no longer safe for the settlers
to stir beyond the works at San Mateo and St. Augustine. Captain Martin
de Ochoa, one of the bravest and most faithful officers, was slain at San
Mateo; and Captain Diego de Hevia and several others were cut off at St.
Augustine. Emboldened by success, the Indians invested the latter fort,
and not only sent showers of arrows into it, but by means of blazing arrows
set fire to the palmetto thatching of the storehouses. The Spaniards in
vain endeavored to extinguish the flames; the building was consumed, with
all their munitions, cloth, linen, and even the colors of the <i>adelantado</i> and
the troops. This encouraged the Indians, who despatched every Spaniard
they could reach.</p>

<p>Menendez reached St. Augustine, March 20, to find it on the brink
of ruin. Even his presence and the force at his command could not bring
the mutineers to obedience. He was obliged to allow Captain San Vicente
and many others to embark in a vessel. Of the men whom at great labor
and expense he had brought to Florida, full five hundred deserted. After
their departure he restored order; and, proceeding to San Mateo, relieved
that place. His next step was to enter into friendly relations with the chief
of Guale, and to begin a fort of stockades, earth, and fascines at Port Royal
which he called San Felipe. Here he left one hundred and ten men under
Stephen de las Alas. From this point the adventurous Captain Pardo, in
1566 and the following year, explored the country, penetrating to the silver
region of the Cherokees, and visiting towns reached by De Soto from
Cofitachiqui to Tascaluza.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p>Returning to St. Augustine, Menendez transferred the fort to its present
position, to be nearer the ship landing and less exposed to the Indians. All
the posts suffered from want of food; and even for the soldiers in the King’s
pay the <i>adelantado</i> could obtain no rations from Havana, although he went
there in person. He obtained means to purchase the necessary provisions
only by pledging his own personal effects.</p>

<p>Before his return there came a fleet of seventeen vessels, bearing fifteen
hundred men, with arms, munitions, and supplies, under Sancho de Arciniega.
Relief was immediately sent to San Mateo and to Santa Elena, where most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of the soldiers had mutinied, and had put Stephen de las Alas in irons, and
sailed away. Menendez divided part of his reinforcements among his three
posts, and then with light vessels ascended the St. John’s. He endeavored
to enter into negotiations with the caciques Otina and Macoya; but those
chiefs, fearing that he had come to demand reparation for the attacks on the
Spaniards, fled at his approach. He ascended the river till he found the
stream narrow, and hostile Indians lining the banks. On his downward
voyage Otina, after making conditions, received the <i>adelantado</i>, who came
ashore with only a few attendants. The chief was surrounded by three
hundred warriors; but showed no hostility, and agreed to become friendly
to the Spaniards.</p>

<p>On his return Menendez despatched a captain with thirty soldiers and
two Dominican friars to establish a post on Chesapeake Bay; they were
accompanied by Don Luis Velasco, brother of the chief of Axacan, who
had been taken from that country apparently by Villafañe, and who had
been baptized in Mexico. Instead, however, of carrying out his plans, the
party persuaded the captain of the vessel to sail to Spain.</p>

<p>Two Jesuit Fathers also came to found missions among the Indians; but
one of them, Father Martinez, landing on the coast, was killed by the
Indians; and the survivor, Father Rogel, with a lay brother, by the direction
of Menendez began to study the language of the chief Carlos, in order
to found a mission in his tribe. To facilitate this, Menendez sent Captain
Reynoso to establish a post in that part of Florida.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>News having arrived that the French were preparing to attack Florida,
and their depredations in the Antilles having increased, Menendez sailed
to Porto Rico, and cruised about for a time, endeavoring to meet some of
the corsairs. But he was unable to come up with any; and after visiting
Carlos and Tequeste, where missions were now established, he returned
to St. Augustine. His efforts, individually and through his lieutenants, to
gain the native chiefs had been to some extent successful; Saturiba was
the only cacique who held aloof. He finally agreed to meet Menendez at
the mouth of the St. John’s; but, as the Spanish commander soon learned,
the cacique had a large force in ambush, with the object of cutting him and
his men off when they landed. Finding war necessary, Menendez then sent
four detachments, each of seventy men, against Saturiba; but he fled, and
the Spaniards returned after skirmishes with small bands, in which they
killed thirty Indians.</p>

<p>Leaving his posts well defended and supplied, Menendez sailed to
Spain; and landing near Coruña, visited his home at Aviles to see his wife
and family, from whom he had been separated twenty years. He then
proceeded to Valladolid, where, on the 20th of July, he was received with
honor by the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>During his absence a French attack, such as he had expected, was made
on Florida. Fearing this, he had endeavored to obtain forces and supplies
for his colony; but was detained, fretting and chafing at the delays and
formalities of the <i>Casa de Contratacion</i> in Seville.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p>An expedition, comprising one small and two large vessels, was fitted out
at Bordeaux by Dominic de Gourgues, with a commission to capture slaves
at Benin. De Gourgues sailed Aug. 22, 1567, and at Cape Blanco had a
skirmish with some negro chiefs, secured the harbor, and sailed off with a
cargo of slaves. With these he ran to the Spanish West Indies, and disposed
of them at Dominica, Porto Rico, and Santo Domingo, finding Spaniards
ready to treat with him. At Puerto de la Plata, in the last island, he met a
ready confederate in Zaballos, who was accustomed to trade with the French
pirates. Zaballos bought slaves and goods from him, and furnished him a
pilot for the Florida coast. Puerto de la Plata had been a refuge for some
of the deserters from Florida, and could afford definite information. Here
probably the idea of Gourgues’ Florida expedition originated; though,
according to the bombastic French account, it was only off the Island of
Cuba that De Gourgues revealed his design. He reached the mouth of the
St. John’s, where the French narratives place two forts that are utterly
unknown in Spanish documents, and which were probably only batteries
to cover the entrance. Saluted here as Spanish, the French vessels passed
on, and anchored off the mouth of the St. Mary’s,&mdash;the Tacatacuru of the
Indians. By means of a Frenchman, a refugee among the Indians, Gourgues
easily induced Saturiba, smarting under the recent Spanish attack, to
join him in a campaign against San Mateo. The first redoubt was quickly
taken; and the French, crossing in boats, their allies swimming, captured
the second, and then moved on Fort San Mateo itself. The French account
makes sixty men issue from each of what it calls forts, each party to be
cut off by the French, and then makes all of each party of sixty to fall by
the hands of the French and Indians, except fifteen or thereabout kept
for an ignominious death.</p>

<p>Gourgues carried off the artillery of the fort and redoubts; but
before he could transport the rest of his booty to the vessels, a train
left by the Spaniards in the fort was accidentally fired by an Indian who
was cooking fish; the magazine blew up, with all in it. Gourgues
hanged the prisoners who fell into his hands at San Mateo, and descending
the river, hanged thirty more at the mouth, setting up an inscription:
“Not as to Spaniards, but as to Traitors, Robbers, and Murderers.”
Returning to his vessels, he hoisted sail on the 3d of May, and early
in June entered the harbor of La Rochelle. His loss, which is not explained,
is said to have been his smallest vessel, five gentlemen and some
soldiers killed.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

to Carolina.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>When Gourgues made his descent, Menendez was already at sea, having
sailed from San Lucar on the 13th of March, with abundant supplies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
reinforcements, as well as additional missionaries for the Indians, under
Father John Baptist Segura as vice-provincial. After relieving his posts in
Florida and placing a hundred and fifty men at San Mateo, he proceeded
to Cuba, of which he had been appointed governor. To strengthen his
colony, he solicited permission to colonize the Rio Pánuco; but the authorities
in Mexico opposed his project, and it failed. The Mississippi,
then known as the Espiritu Santo, was supposed to flow from the neighborhood
of Santa Elena, and was depended on as a means of communication.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
The next year the <i>adelantado</i> sent a hundred and ninety-three persons to
San Felipe, and eighty to St. Augustine. Father Rogel then began missions
among the Indians around Port Royal; Father Sedeño and Brother Baez began
similar labors on Guale (now Amelia) Island, the latter soon compiling a
grammar and catechism in the language of the Indians. Others attempted
to bring the intractable chief Carlos and his tribe within the Christian fold.
Rogel drew Indians to his mission at Orista; he put up houses and a church,
and endeavored to induce them to cultivate the ground. But their natural
fickleness would not submit to control; they soon abandoned the place, and
the missionary returned to Fort San Felipe. A school for Indian boys was
opened in Havana, and youths from the tribes of the coast were sent there
in the hope of making them the nucleus of an Indian civilization. In 1570
Menendez, carrying out his project of occupying Chesapeake Bay, sent
Father Segura with several other Jesuits to establish a mission at Axacan,
the country of the Indian known as Don Luis Velasco, who accompanied
missionaries, promising to do all in his power to secure for them a welcome
from his tribe. The vessel evidently ascended the Potomac and landed the
mission party, who then crossed to the shores of the Rappahannock.
They were received with seeming friendship, and erected a rude chapel;
but the Indians soon showed a hostile spirit, and ultimately massacred all
the party except an Indian boy. When Menendez returned to Florida from
Spain in 1572, he sailed to the Chesapeake, and endeavored to secure Don
Luis and his brother; but they fled. He captured eight Indians known
to have taken part in the murder of the missionaries, and hanged them at
the yard-arm of his vessel.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>From this time Menendez gave little personal attention to the affairs of
Florida, being elsewhere engaged by the King; and he died at Santander,
in Spain, Sept. 17, 1574, when about to take command of an immense fleet
which Philip II. was preparing. With his death Florida, where his nephew
Pedro Menendez Marquez<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> had acted as governor, languished. Indian hostilities
increased, San Felipe was invested, abandoned, and burned, and
soon after the Governor himself was slain.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> St. Augustine was finally

<p class="drop-cap08">OUR account of the voyages of Ponce de Leon is mainly from the <i>cédulas</i> to him and

<p>Of the pioneer expedition which Camargo conducted for Garay to make settlement
of Amichel, and of its encounter with Cortés, we have the effect which the first tidings of
it produced on the mind of the Conqueror of Mexico in his second letter of Oct. 30, 1520;
while in his third letter he made representations of the wrongs done to the Indians by
Garay’s people, and of his own determination to protect the chiefs who had submitted
to him.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> For the untoward ending of Garay’s main expedition, Cortés is still a principal
dependence in his fourth letter;<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> and the official records of his proceedings against Garay
in October, 1523, with a letter of Garay dated November 8, and evidently addressed to
Cortés, are to be found in the <i>Documentos inéditos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> while Peter Martyr,<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> Oviedo,<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> and

         <p class="pf300">[This sketch follows Dr. Kohl’s copy of a
map in a manuscript atlas in the British Museum
(no. 9,814), without date; but it seems to be a
record of the explorations (1520) of Ayllon,
whose name is corrupted on the map. The
map bears near the main inscription the figure
of a Chinaman and an elephant,&mdash;tokens of
the current belief in the Asiatic connections
of North America. Cf. Brinton’s <i>Floridian
Peninsula</i>, p. 82, 99, on the “Traza de costas
de Tierra Ferme y de las Tierras Nuevas,” accompanying
the royal grant to Garay in 1521,
being the chart of Cristóbal de Tobia, given
in the third volume of Navarrete’s <i>Coleccion</i>,
and sketched on another page of the present
volume (<i>ante</i>, p. 218) in a section on “The Early
Cartography of the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent
Parts,” where some light is thrown on contemporary
knowledge of the Florida coast.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of the preliminary expedition on the Atlantic coast of Gordillo and the subsequent
attempt of his chief, Ayllon, to settle in Virginia, there is a fund of testimony in the
papers of the suit which Matienzo instituted against Ayllon, and of which the greater part
is still unprinted; but a few papers, like the complaint of Matienzo and some testimony
taken by Ayllon when about to sail himself, can be found in the <i>Documentos inéditos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>
As regards the joint explorations of the vessels of Gordillo and Quexos, the testimony
of the latter helps
us, as well as his
act of taking possession,
which puts the
proceeding in 1521;
though some of Ayllon’s
witnesses give
1520 as the date.
Both parties unite
in calling the river
which they reached
the San Juan Bautista,
and the <i>cédula</i>
to Ayllon places it
in thirty-five degrees.
Navarrete in
saying they touched
at Chicora and Gualdape
confounds the
first and third voyages; and was clearly ignorant of the three distinct expeditions;<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> and
Herrera is wrong in calling the river the Jordan,<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a>&mdash;named, as he says, after the captain
or pilot of one of the vessels,&mdash;since no such person was on either vessel, and
no such name appears in the testimony: the true Jordan was the Wateree (Guatari).<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>
That it was the intention of Ayllon to make the expedition one of slave-catching, would
seem to be abundantly disproved by his condemnation of the commander’s act.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>Ayllon, according to Spanish writers, after reaching the coast in his own voyage,
in 1526, took a northerly course. Herrera<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> says he attempted to colonize north
of Cape Trafalgar (Hatteras); and the <i>piloto mayor</i> of Florida, Ecija, who at a
later day, in 1609, was sent to find out what the English were doing, says positively
that Ayllon had fixed his settlement at Guandape. Since by his office Ecija
must have had in his possession the early charts of his people, and must have made
the locality a matter of special study, his assertion has far greater weight than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of any historian writing in Spain merely from documents.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> It is also the opinion of
Navarrete<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> that Ayllon’s course must have been north.</p>

<p>Oviedo<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> does not define the region of this settlement more closely than to say that it
was under thirty-three degrees, adding that it is not laid down on any map. The Oydores
of Santo Domingo, in a letter to the King in 1528,<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> only briefly report the expedition, and
refer for particulars to Father Antonio Montesinos.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Upon the expedition of Narvaez, and particularly upon the part taken in it by Cabeza
de Vaca, the principal authority is the narrative of the latter published at Zamora in 1542
as <i>La relacion que dio Aluar Nuñez

Valladolid in 1555, in an edition
usually quoted as <i>La relacion

in his <i>Collection</i><a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> in 1556. A French version was given by Ternaux in 1837.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> The earliest

version was made
by the late Buckingham
Smith, and
printed (100 copies)
at the expense

with a revision of
the translation and
considerable additional

beyond what can be gathered from Cabeza de Vaca himself. He adds, however,
engravings of Father Juan Xuarez and Brother Juan Palos, after portraits preserved
in Mexico of the twelve Franciscans who were first sent to that country.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Some additional facts respecting this expedition are derived at second hand from a
letter which Cabeza de Vaca and Dorantes wrote after their arrival in Mexico to the
<i>Andiencia</i> of Hispaniola, which is not now known, but of which the substance is
professedly given by Oviedo.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></p>

<p>The Bahia de la Cruz of Narvaez’ landing, made identical with Apalache Bay by
Cabot, is likely to have been by him correctly identified, as the point could be fixed by
the pilots who returned with the ships to Cuba, and would naturally be recorded on the
charts.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> Smith<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> believed it to be Tampa Bay. The <i>Relacion</i> describes the bay as one
whose head could be seen from the mouth; though its author seems in another place to
make it seven or eight leagues deep.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Narvaez and his party evidently thought they were
nearer Panuco, and had no idea they were so near Havana. Had they been at Tampa Bay,
or on a coast running north and south, they can scarcely be supposed to have been so
egregiously mistaken.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> If Tampa was his landing place, it is necessary to consider the bay
where he subsequently built his boats as Apalache Bay.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> Charlevoix<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> identifies it with
Apalache Bay, and Siguenza y Gongora finds it in Pensacola.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p>Of the expedition of Soto we have good and on the whole satisfactory records. The
Concession made by the Spanish King of the government of Cuba and of the conquest
of Florida is preserved to us.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> There are three contemporary narratives of the progress
of the march. The first and best was printed in 1557 at Evora as the <i>Relaçam verdadeira

since Hakluyt first translated it, and reprinted it in 1609 at London as <i>Virginia richly

in the Archivo General de Indias at Seville,<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> and was first published in a French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>

<p>In 1866 Mr. Smith published

the fifth volume (125 copies)
of the Bradford Club Series

<p>The third of the original
accounts is the <i>Florida del

Theodore Irving<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> and others have accepted it. It is based upon conversations with a
noble Spaniard who had accompanied Soto as a volunteer, and upon the written but illiterate
reports of two common soldiers,&mdash;Alonzo de Carmona, of Priego, and Juan Coles, of
Zabra.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> Herrera largely embodied it in his <i>Historia general</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Still another account of the expedition is the official Report which Rodrigo Ranjel, the
secretary of Soto, based upon his Diary kept on the march. It was written after reaching
Mexico, whence he transmitted it to the Spanish Government. It remained unpublished
in that part of Oviedo’s <i>History</i> which was preserved in manuscript till Amador de los Rios
issued his edition of Oviedo in 1851. Oviedo seems to have begun to give the text of
Ranjel as he found it; but later in the progress of the story he abridges it greatly, and two
chapters at least are missing, which must have given the wanderings of Soto from
Autiamque, with his death, and the adventures of the survivors under Mosçoso. The
original text of Ranjel is not known.</p>

<p>These independent narratives of the Gentlemen of Elvas, Biedma, and Ranjel, as well
as those used by Garcilasso de la Vega, agree remarkably, not only in the main narrative as
to course and events, but also as to the names of the places.</p>

<p>There is also a letter of Soto, dated July 9, 1539, describing his voyage and landing,
which was published by Buckingham Smith in 1854 at Washington,<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> following a transcript
(in the Lenox Library) of a document in the Archives at Simancas, and attested by Muñoz.
It is addressed to the municipality of Santiago de Cuba, and was first made known in
Ternaux’s <i>Recueil des pièces sur la Floride</i>. B. F. French gave the first English version
of it in his <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana</i>, part ii. pp. 89-93 (1850).<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a></p>

<p>The route of De Soto is, of course, a question for a variety of views.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> We have in the
preceding narrative followed for the track through Georgia a paper read by Colonel Charles
C. Jones, Jr., before the Georgia Historical Society, and printed in Savannah in 1880,<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> and
for that through Alabama the data given by Pickett in his <i>History of Alabama</i>,<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> whose
local knowledge adds weight to his opinion.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> As to the point of De Soto’s crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Mississippi, there is a very general agreement on the lowest Chickasaw Bluff.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> We are
without the means, in any of the original sources, to determine beyond dispute the most
northerly point reached
by Soto. He had evidently
approached, but
had learned nothing of,
the Missouri River.
Almost at the same
time that Soto, with the
naked, starving remnant
of his army, was
at Pacaha, another
Spanish force under
Vasquez de Coronado,
well handled and perfectly
equipped, must
in July and August,
1541, have been encamped
so near that an
Indian runner in a few
days might have carried
tidings between them.
Coronado actually
heard of his countryman,
and sent him a letter; but his messenger failed to find Soto’s party.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> But, strangely
enough, the cruel, useless expedition of Soto finds ample space in history, while the well-managed
march of Coronado’s careful exploration finds scant mention.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> No greater
contrast exists in our history than that between these two campaigns.</p>

<p class="p2">A sufficient indication has been given, in the notes of the preceding narrative, of the
sources of information concerning the futile attempts of the Spaniards at colonization on
the Atlantic coast up to the time of the occupation of Port Royal by Ribault in 1562. Of
the consequent bloody struggle between the Spanish Catholics and the French Huguenots
there are original sources on both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Spanish part we have the <i>Cartas escritas al rey</i> of Pedro Menendez (Sept.
11, Oct. 15, and Dec. 5, 1565), which are preserved in the Archives at Seville, and have
been used by Parkman,<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> and the <i>Memoria del buen suceso i buen viage</i> of the chaplain
of the expedition, Francisco Lopez de Mendoza Grajales.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> Barcia’s <i>Ensayo cronológico</i>
is the most comprehensive of the Spanish accounts, and he gives a large part of the
<i>Memorial de las jornadas</i> of Solis de Meras, a brother-in-law of Menendez. It has
never been printed separately; but Charlevoix used Barcia’s extract, and it is translated
from Barcia in French’s <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana and Florida</i> (vol. ii. p. 216).
Barcia seems also to have had access to the papers of Menendez,<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> and to have
received this Journal of Solis directly from his family.</p>

<p>On the French side, for the first expedition of Ribault in 1562 we have the very scarce
text of the <i>Histoire de l’expédition Française en Floride</i>, published in London in 1563,
which Hakluyt refers to as being in print “in French and English” when he wrote his
<i>Westerne Planting</i>.<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> Sparks<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> could not find that it was ever published in French; nor
was Winter Jones aware of the existence of this 1563 edition when he prepared for the
Hakluyt Society an issue of Hakluyt’s <i>Divers Voyages</i> (1582), in which that collector
had included an English version of it as <i>The True and Last Discoverie of Florida,
translated into Englishe by one Thomas Hackit</i>, being the same text which appeared
separately in 1563 as the <i>Whole and True Discovery of Terra Florida</i>.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>At Paris in 1586 appeared a volume, dedicated to Sir Walter Raleigh, entitled,
<i>L’histoire notable de la Floride, ... contenant les trois voyages faits en icelle par
certains capitaines et pilotes François descrits par le Capitaine Laudonnière, ... à
laquelle a esté adjousté un quatriesme voyage fait par le Capitaine Gourgues, Mise en
lumiere par M. Basanier</i>. This was a comprehensive account, or rather compilation,
of the four several French expeditions,&mdash;1562, 1564, 1565, 1567,&mdash;covering the letters
of Laudonnière for the first three, and an anonymous account, perhaps by the editor
Basanier, of the fourth. Hakluyt, who had induced the French publication, gave the
whole an English dress in his <i>Notable History, translated by R. H.</i>, printed in London
in 1587,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> and again in his <i>Principall Navigations</i>, vol. iii., the text of which is also to
be found in the later edition and in French’s <i>Historical Collections of Louisiana and
Florida</i> (1869), i. 165.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

         <p class="pf400">[This map of Delisle, issued originally at
Paris, is given in the Amsterdam (1707) edition
of Garcilasso de la Vega’s <i>Histoire des Incas et de
la conquête de la Floride</i>, vol. ii; cf. <i>Voyages au
nord</i>, vol. v., and Delisle’s <i>Atlas nouveau</i>. The
map is also reproduced in French’s <i>Historical
Collections of Louisiana</i>, and Gravier’s <i>La Salle</i>
(1870). Other maps of the route are given by
Rye, McCulloch, and Irving; by J. C. Brevoort
in Smith’s <i>Narratives of Hernando de Soto</i>, and in
Paul Chaix’ <i>Bassin du Mississipi au seizième siècle</i>.</p>

<p class="pf400">Besides the references already noted, the question
of his route has been discussed, to a greater
or less extent, in Charlevoix’ <i>Nouvelle France</i>;
in Warden’s <i>Chronologie historique de l’Amérique</i>,
where the views of the geographer Homann are
cited; in Albert Gallatin’s “Synopsis of the
Indian Tribes” in the <i>Archæologia Americana</i>,
vol. ii.; in Nuttall’s <i>Travels in Arkansas</i> (1819
and 1821); in Williams’s <i>Florida</i> (New York,
1837); in McCulloch’s <i>Antiquarian Researches
in America</i> (Baltimore, 1829); in Schoolcraft’s
<i>Indian Tribes</i>, vol. iii.; in Paul Chaix’ <i>Bassin

Magazine</i>, lxiii. 457; in <i>Sharpe’s Magazine</i>,
xlii. 265; and in Lambert A. Wilmer’s <i>Life
of De Soto</i> (1858). Although Dr. Belknap in his
<i>American Biography</i> (1794, vol. i. p. 189), had
sought to establish a few points of De Soto’s
march, the earliest attempt to track his steps
closely was made by Alexander Meek, in a paper
published at Tuscaloosa in 1839 in <i>The Southron</i>,
and reprinted as “The Pilgrimage of De Soto,”
in his <i>Romantic Passages in Southwestern History</i>
(Mobile, 1857), p. 213. Irving, in the revised
edition of his <i>Conquest of Florida</i>, depended
largely upon the assistance of Fairbanks and
Smith, and agrees mainly with Meek and Pickett.
In his appendix he epitomizes the indications of
the route according to Garcilasso and the Portuguese
gentleman. Rye collates the statements
of McCulloch and Monette regarding the route
beyond the Mississippi, and infers that the identifying
of the localities is almost impossible.
Chaix (<i>Bassin du Mississipi</i>) also traces this
part.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>Jacques Lemoyne de Morgues, an artist accompanying Laudonnière, wrote some years
later an account, and made maps and drawings, with notes describing them. De Bry

but Lemoyne resisted all persuasions to part with his papers.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> After Lemoyne’s death

a translation of Le Challeux, the <i>De Gallorum expeditione in Floridam anno MDLXV

<p>It was not long before exaggerated statements were circulated, based upon the
representations made in <i>Une requête au roi</i> (Charles IX.) of the widows and orphans
of the victims of Menendez, in which the number of the slain is reported at the impossible
figure of nine hundred.<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the expedition of De Gourgues there are no Spanish accounts whatever,
Barcia<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> merely taking in the main the French narrative,&mdash;in which, says Parkman,
“it must be admitted there is a savor of romance.”<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> That Gourgues was merely
a slaver is evident from this full French account. Garibay notes his attempt to capture
at least one Spanish vessel; and he certainly had on reaching Florida two barks,
which he must have captured on his way. Basanier and many who follow him suppress
entirely the slaver episode in this voyage. All the De Gourgues narratives ignore
entirely the existence of St. Augustine, and make the three pretended forts on the St.
John to have been of stone; and Prévost, to heighten the picture, invents the story of
the flaying of Ribault, of which there is no trace in the earlier French accounts.</p>

<p>There are two French narratives. One of them, <i>La reprinse de la Floride</i>, exists,
according to Gaffarel,<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> in five different manuscript texts.<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> The other French narrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
is the last paper in the compilation of Basanier, already mentioned. Brinton<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> is inclined
to believe that it is not an epitome of the <i>Reprinse</i>, but that it was written by Basanier
himself from the floating accounts of his day, or from some unknown relater. Charlevoix
mentions a manuscript in the possession of the De Gourgues family; but it is not clear
which of these papers it was.</p>

<p>The story of the Huguenot colony passed naturally into the historical records of the
seventeenth century;<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> but it got more special treatment in the next century, when

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">LAS CASAS, AND THE RELATIONS OF THE SPANIARDS TO
THE INDIANS.</p>

<p class="pc2">BY GEORGE EDWARD ELLIS,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Vice-President of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN the great apostle of the new faith, on his voyage from Asia
to Europe, was shipwrecked on a Mediterranean island, “the barbarous
people” showed him and his company “no little kindness.” On
first acquaintance with their chief visitor they hastily judged him to be a
murderer, whom, though he had escaped the sea, yet vengeance would not
suffer to live. But afterward “they changed their minds, and said that
he was a god.”<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> The same extreme revulsion of feeling and judgment
was wrought in the minds of the natives of this New World when the
ocean-tossed voyagers from the old continent first landed on these shores,
bringing the parted representatives of humanity on this globe into mutual
acquaintance and intercourse. Only in this latter case the change of
feeling and judgment was inverted. The simple natives of the fair western
island regarded their mysterious visitors as superhuman beings; further
knowledge of them proved them to be “murderers,” rapacious, cruel,
and inhuman,&mdash;fit subjects for a dire vengeance.</p>

<p>In these softer times of ours the subject of the present chapter might
well be passed silently, denied a revival, and left in the pitiful oblivion
which covers so many of the distressing horrors of “man’s inhumanity to
man.” But, happily for the writer and for the reader, the title of the chapter
is a double one, and embraces two themes. The painful narrative to
be rehearsed is to be relieved by a tribute of admiring and reverential
homage to a saintly man of signal virtues and heroic services, one of the
grandest and most august characters in the world’s history. Many of the obscure
and a few of the dismal elements and incidents of long-passed times,
in the rehearsal of them on fresh pages, are to a degree relieved by new
light thrown upon them, by the detection and exposure of errors, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
readjustments of truth. Gladly would a writer on the subject before us
avail himself of any such means to reduce or to qualify its repulsiveness.
But advancing time, with the assertion of the higher instincts of humanity
which have sharpened regrets and reproaches for all the enormities of the
past, has not furnished any abatements for the faithful dealing with this
subject other than that just presented.</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of a pause for thought, that in no single instance since
the discovery of our islands and continent by Europeans&mdash;to say nothing
about the times before it&mdash;has any new race of men come to the knowledge
of travellers, explorers, and visitors from the realms of so-called
civilization, when the conditions were so fair and favorable in the first
introduction and acquaintance between the parties as in that between
Columbus and the natives of the sea-girt isle of Hispaniola. Not even in
the sweetest idealizings of romance is there a more fascinating picture than
that which he draws of those unsophisticated children of Nature, their gentleness,
docility, and friendliness. They were not hideous or repulsive, as
barbarians; they did not revolt the sight, like many of the African tribes,
like Bushmen, Feejeans, or Hottentots; they presented no caricaturings of
humanity, as giants or dwarfs, as Amazons or Esquimaux; their naked
bodies were not mutilated, gashed, or painted; they uttered no yells or
shrieks, with mad and threatening gestures. They were attractive in person,
well formed, winning and gentle, and trustful; they were lithe and soft
of skin, and their hospitality was spontaneous, generous, and genial. Tribes
of more warlike and less gracious nature proved to exist on some of the
islands, about the isthmus and the continental regions of the early invasion;
but the first introduction and intercourse of the representatives of the
parted continents set before the Europeans a race of their fellow-creatures
with whom they might have lived and dealt in peace and love.</p>

<p>And what shall we say of the new-comers, the Spaniards,&mdash;the subjects
of the proudest of monarchies, the representatives of the age of chivalry;
gentlemen, nobles, disciples of the one Holy Catholic Church, and soldiers
of the Cross of Christ? What sort of men were they, what was their
errand, and what impress did they leave upon the scenes so fair before
their coming, and upon those children of Nature whom they found so
innocent and loving, and by whom they were at first gazed upon with awe
and reverence as gods?</p>

<p>In only one score of the threescore years embraced in our present subject
the Spaniards had sown desolation, havoc, and misery in and around
their track. They had depopulated some of the best-peopled of the islands,
and renewed them with victims deported from others. They had inflicted
upon hundreds of thousands of the natives all the forms and agonies of fiendish
cruelty, driving them to self-starvation and suicide as a way of mercy
and release from an utterly wretched existence. They had come to be
viewed by their victims as fiends of hate, malignity, and all dark and cruel
desperation and mercilessness in passion. The hell which they denounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
upon their victims was shorn of its worst terror by the assurance that these
tormentors were not to be there.</p>

<p>Only what is needful for the truth of history is to be told here, while
shocking details are to be passed by. And as the rehearsal is made to set
forth in relief the nobleness, grandeur of soul, and heroism of a man whose
nearly a century of years was spent in holy rebuke, protest, exposure, and
attempted redress of this work of iniquity, a reader may avert his gaze from
the narration of the iniquity and fix it upon the character and career of the
“Apostle to the Indians.”</p>

<p>There was something phenomenal and monstrous, something so aimless,
reckless, wanton, unprovoked, utterly ruinous even for themselves, in that
course of riot and atrocity pursued by the Spaniards, which leads us&mdash;while
palliation and excuse are out of the question&mdash;to seek some physical or
moral explanation of it. This has generally been found in referring to the
training of Spanish nature in inhumanity, cruelty, contempt of human life,
and obduracy of feeling, through many centuries of ruthless warfare. It
was in the very year of the discovery of America that the Spaniards, in the
conquest of Granada, had finished their eight centuries of continuous war
for wresting their proud country from the invading Moors. This war had
made every Spaniard a fighter, and every infidel an enemy exempted from
all tolerance and mercy. Treachery, defiance of pledges and treaties, brutalities,
and all wild and reckless stratagems, had educated the champions
of the Cross and faith in what were to them but the accomplishments of the
soldier and the fidelity of the believer. Even in the immunities covenanted
to the subject-Moors, of tolerance in their old home and creed, the ingenuities
of their implacable foes found the means of new devices for oppression
and outrage. The Holy Office of the Inquisition, with all its cavernous
secrets and fiendish processes, dates also from the same period, and gave its
fearful consecration to all the most direful passions.</p>

<p>With that training in inhumanity and cruelty which the Spanish adventurers
brought to these shores, we must take into view that towering, overmastering
rapacity and greed which were to glut themselves upon the spoils
of mines, precious stones, and pearls. The rich soil, with the lightest tillage,
would have yielded its splendid crops for man and beast. Flocks
would have multiplied and found their own sustenance for the whole year
without any storage in garner, barn, or granary. A rewarding commerce
would have enriched merchants on either side of well-traversed ocean pathways.
But not the slightest thought or recognition was given during the
first half-century of the invasion to any such enterprise as is suggested by
the terms colonization, the occupancy of soil for husbandry and domestication.
Spanish pride, indolence, thriftlessness regarded every form of
manual labor as a demeaning humiliation. There was no peasantry among
the new-comers. The humblest of them in birth, rank, and means was a
gentleman; his hands could not hold a spade or a rake, or guide the
plough. The horse and the hound were the only beasts on his inventory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of values. Sudden and vast enrichment by the treasures of gold
wrung from the natives, first in their fragmentary ornaments, and then by
compulsory toil from the mines which would yield it in heaps, were the
lure and passion of the invaders. The natives, before they could reach any
conception of the Divine Being of the Catholic creed, soon came to the
understanding of the real object of their worship: as a cacique plainly
set forth to a group of his trembling subjects, when, holding up a piece of
gold, he said, “This is the Spaniards’ god.” A sordid passion, with its
overmastery of all the sentiments of humanity, would inflame the nerves
and intensify all the brutal propensities which are but masked in men of
a low range of development even under the restraints of social and civil
life. We must allow for the utter recklessness and frenzy of their full indulgence
under the fervors of hot climes, in the loosening of all domestic
and neighborly obligations, in the homelessness of exile and the mad freedom
of adventure. Under the fretting discomforts and restraints of the
ocean-passage hither, the imagination of these rapacious treasure-seekers
fed itself on visions of wild license of arbitrary power over simple victims,
and of heaps of treasure to be soon carried back to Spain to make a long
revel in self-indulgence for the rest of life.</p>

<p>“Cruelties” was the comprehensive term under which Las Casas gathered
all the enormities and barbarities, of which he was a witness for half a century,
as perpetrated on the successive scenes invaded by his countrymen
on the islands and the main of the New World. He had seen thousands
of the natives crowded together, naked and helpless, for slaughter, like
sheep in a park or meadow. He had seen them wasted at the extremities
by torturing fires, till, after hours of agony, they turned their dying gaze,
rather in amazed dread than in rage, upon their tormentors. Mutilations
of hands, feet, ears, and noses surrounded him with ghastly spectacles of
all the processes of death without disease. One may well leave all details
to the imagination; and may do this all the more willingly that even the
imagination will fail to fill and fashion the reality of the horror.</p>

<p class="p2">Previous to the successful ventures on the western ocean, the Portuguese
had been resolutely pursuing the work of discovery by pushing their daring
enterprise farther and farther down the coast of Africa, till they at last
turned the Cape.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> The deportation of the natives and their sale as slaves
at once became first an incidental reward, and then the leading aim of
craving adventurers. It was but natural that the Spaniards should turn
their success in other regions to the same account. Heathen lands and
heathen people belonged by Papal donation to the soldiers of the Cross;
they were the heritage of the Church. The plea of conversion answered
equally for conquest and subjugation of the natives on their own soil,
and for transporting them to the scenes and sharers of a pure and saving
faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>A brief summary of the acts and incidents in the first enslavement of
the natives may here be set down. Columbus took with him to Spain,
on his first return, nine natives. While on his second voyage he sent to
Spain, in January, 1494, by a return vessel, a considerable number, described
as Caribs, “from the Cannibal Islands,” for “slaves.” They were
to be taught Castilian, to serve as interpreters for the work of “conversion”
when restored to their native shores. Columbus pleads that it will benefit
them by the saving of their souls, while the capture and enslaving of them
will give the Spaniards consequence as evidence of power. Was this even
a plausible excuse, and were the victims really cannibals? The sovereigns
seemed to approve the act, but intimated that the “cannibals” might be
converted at home, without the trouble of transportation. But Columbus
enlarged and generalized sweepingly upon his scheme, afterward adding to
it a secular advantage, suggesting that as many as possible of these cannibals
should be caught for the sake of their souls, and then sold in Spain in
payment for cargoes of live stock, provisions, and goods, which were much
needed in the islands. The monarchs for a while suspended their decision
of this matter. But the abominable traffic was steadily catching new agents
and victims, and the slave-trade became a leading motive for advancing the
rage for further discoveries. The Portuguese were driving the work eastward,
while the Spaniards were keenly following it westward. In February,
1495, Columbus sent back four ships, whose chief lading was slaves. From
that time began the horrors attending the crowding of human cargoes with
scant food and water, with filth and disease, and the daily throwing over
into the sea those who were privileged to die. Yet more victims were taken
by Columbus when he was again in Spain in June, 1496, to circumvent his
enemies. Being here again in 1498, he had no positive prohibition against
continuing the traffic. A distinction was soon recognized, and allowed even
by the humane and pious Isabella. Captives taken in war against the Spaniards
might be brought to Spain and kept in slavery; but natives who had
been seized for the purpose of enslaving them, she indignantly ordered
should be restored to freedom. This wrong, as well as that of the <i>repartimiento</i>
system, in the distribution of natives to Spanish masters as laborers,
was slightly held in check by this lovable lady during her life. She died
while Columbus was in Spain, Nov. 26, 1504. Columbus died at Valladolid,
May 20, 1506. The ill that he had done lived after him, to qualify the
splendor of his nobleness, grandeur, and constancy.</p>

<p>And here we may bring upon the scene that one, the only Spaniard
who stands out luminously, in the heroism and glory of true sanctity, amid
these gory scenes, himself a true soldier of Christ.</p>

<p class="p2">Bartholomew Las Casas was born at Seville in 1474. Llorente&mdash;a faithful
biographer, and able editor and expositor of his writings, of whom
farther on we are to say much more&mdash;asserts that the family was French
in its origin, the true name being Casuas; which appears, indeed, as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
alias on the titlepage of some of his writings published by the apostle in
his lifetime.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p>Antoine Las Casas, the father of Bartholomew, was a soldier in the
marine service of Spain. We find no reference to him as being either in
sympathy or otherwise with the absorbing aim which ennobled the career
of his son. He accompanied Columbus on his first western voyage in
1492, and returned with him to Spain in 1493.</p>

<p>During the absence of the father on this voyage the son, at the age of
eighteen, was completing his studies at Salamanca. In May, 1498,<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> at the
age of about twenty-four, he went to the Indies with his father, in employment
under Columbus, and returned to Cadiz, Nov. 25, 1500. In an address
to the Emperor in 1542, Bartholomew reminded him that Columbus
had given liberty to each of several of his fellow-voyagers to take to Spain
a single native of the islands for personal service, and that a youth among
those so transported had been intrusted to him. Perhaps under these
favoring circumstances this was the occasion of first engaging the sympathies
of Las Casas for the race to whose redemption he was to consecrate
his life. Isabella, however, was highly indignant at this outrage upon
the natives, and under pain of death to the culprits ordered the victims to
be restored to their country. It would seem that they were all carried
back in 1500 under the Commander Bobadilla, and among them the young
Indian who had been in the service of Bartholomew. One loves to imagine
that in some of the wide wanderings of the latter, amid the scenes of the
New World, he may again have met with this first specimen of a heathen
race who had been under intimate relations with himself, and who had
undoubtedly been baptized.</p>

<p>We shall find farther on that the grievous charge was brought against
Las Casas, when he had drawn upon himself bitter animosities, that he
was the first to propose the transportation of negro slaves to the islands, in
1517. It is enough to say here, in anticipation, that Governor Ovando, in
1500, received permission to carry thither negro slaves “who had been
born under Christian Powers.” The first so carried were born in Seville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of parents brought from Africa, and obtained through the Portuguese
traffickers.</p>

<p>On May 9, 1502, Las Casas embarked for the second time with Columbus,
reaching San Domingo on June 29. In 1510 he was ordained priest by the
first Bishop of Hispaniola, and was the first ecclesiastic ordained in the
so-called Indies to say there his virgin Mass. This was regarded as a
great occasion, and was attended by crowds; though a story is told, hardly
credible, that there was then not a drop of wine to be obtained in the
colony. The first Dominican monks, under their Bishop, Cordova, reached
the islands in 1510. As we shall find, the Dominicans were from the first,
and always, firm friends, approvers, and helpers of Las Casas in his hard
conflict for asserting the rights of humanity for the outraged natives. The
fact presents us with one of the strange anomalies in history,&mdash;that the
founders and prime agents of the Inquisition in Europe should be the
champions of the heathen in the New World.</p>

<p>The monks in sympathy with the ardent zeal of Las Casas began to
preach vehemently against the atrocious wrongs which were inflicted upon
the wretched natives, and he was sent as curate to a village in Cuba. The
Franciscans, who had preceded the Dominicans, had since 1502 effected
nothing in opposition to these wrongs. Utterly futile were the orders
which came continually from the monarchs against overworking and oppressing
the natives, as their delicate constitutions, unused to bodily toil,
easily sank under its exactions. The injunctions against enslaving them
were positive. Exception was made only in the case of the Caribs, as
reputed cannibals, and the then increasing number of imported negro
slaves, who were supposed to be better capable of hard endurance. Las
Casas was a witness and a most keen and sensitive observer of the inflictions&mdash;lashings
and other torturing atrocities&mdash;by which his fellow-countrymen,
as if goaded by a demoniac spirit, treated these simple and quailing children
of Nature, as if they were organized without sensitiveness of nerve,
fibre, or understanding, requiring of them tasks utterly beyond their
strength, bending them to the earth with crushing burdens, harnessing them
to loads which they could not drag, and with fiendish sport and malice
hacking off their hands and feet, and mutilating their bodies in ways which
will not bear a description. It was when he accompanied the expedition
under Velasquez for the occupation of Cuba, that he first drew the most
jealous and antagonistic opposition and animosity upon himself, as standing
between the natives and his own countrymen, who in their sordidness,
rapacity, and cruelty seemed to have extinguished in themselves every
instinct of humanity and every sentiment of religion. Here too was first
brought into marked observation his wonderful power over the natives
winning their confidence and attachment, as they were ever after docile
under his advice, and learned to look to him as their true friend. We
pause to contemplate this wonderful and most engaging character, as, after
filling his eye and thought with the shocking scenes in which his countrymen&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
name the disciples of Jesus and loyal members of his Church&mdash;perpetrated
such enormities against beings in their own likeness, he began
his incessant tracking of the ocean pathways in his voyages to lay his
remonstrances and appeals before successive monarchs. Beginning this
service in his earliest manhood, he was to labor in it with unabated zeal
till his death, with unimpaired faculties, at the age of ninety-two. He calls
himself “the Clerigo.” He was soon to win and worthily to bear the title
of “Universal Protector of the Indians.” Truly was he a remarkable and
conspicuous personage,&mdash;unique, as rather the anomaly than the product
of his age and land, his race and fellowship. His character impresses us
alike by its loveliness and its ruggedness, its tenderness and its vigor, its
melting sympathy and its robust energies. His mental and moral endowments
were of the strongest and the richest, and his spiritual insight and
fervor well-nigh etherealized him. His gifts and abilities gave him a rich
versatility in capacity and resource. He was immensely in advance of his
age, so as to be actually in antagonism with it. He was free alike from its
prejudices, its limitations, and many of its superstitions, as well as from its
barbarities. He was single-hearted, courageous, fervent, and persistent,
bold and daring as a venturesome voyager over new seas and mysterious
depths of virgin wildernesses, missionary, scholar, theologian, acute logician,
historian, curious observer of Nature, the peer of Saint Paul in wisdom and
zeal. Charles V. coming to the throne at the age of sixteen, when Las Casas
was about forty, was at once won to him by profound respect and strong
attachment, as had been the case with Charles’s grandfather Ferdinand,
whom Las Casas survived fifty years, while he outlived Columbus sixty
years.</p>

<p>The Clerigo found his remonstrances and appeals to his own nominally
Christian fellow-countrymen wholly ineffectual in restraining or even mitigating
the oppressions and cruelties inflicted upon the wretched natives.
There was something phenomenal, as has been said, in the license yielded
to the ingenuity of Spanish barbarity. It combined all the devices of inquisitorial
torturing with the indulgence of the bestial ferocities of the bullfight.
At times it seemed as if the heartless oppressors were seeking only
for a brutal mirth in inventing games in which their victims should writhe
and yell as for their amusement. Then, as opportunity suggested or served,
a scheme of the most cunning treachery and malice would turn an occasion
of revelry or feasting, to which the natives had been invited or been beguiled
by their tormentors, into a riot of fury and massacre. The utter
aimlessness and recklessness of most of these horrid enormities impress
the reader in these days as simply the indulgence of a wanton spirit
in giving free license in human passions to those mocking employments
of grinning devils in the old church paintings as they inflict retributions
on the damned spirits in hell. The forked weapons, the raging flames,
and the hideous demoniac delights exhibited in paintings, with which the
eyes of the Spaniards were so familiar, found their all-too-faithful counterparts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
in the tropical zones and valleys of our virgin islands. The only
pretences offered, not for justifying but for inflicting such wanton barbarities
on the natives, were such as these,&mdash;that they refused to make known
or to guide their oppressors to rich mines, or to work beyond their powers
of endurance, or to bear intolerable burdens, or to furnish food which they
had not to give. Touching and harrowing it is to read of many instances
in which the simple diplomacy of the natives prompted them to neglect the
little labor of husbandry required to supply their own wants, in order that
the invaders might with themselves be brought to starvation. Whenever
the Clerigo accompanied a body of Spaniards on the way to an Indian
village, he always made an effort to keep the two people apart by night
and by day, and he employed himself busily in baptizing infants and little
children. He could never be too quick in this service, as these subjects of
his zeal were the victims of the indiscriminate slaughter. The only consolation
which this tender-hearted yet heroic missionary could find, as his
share in the enterprise of his people, was in keeping the reckoning on his
tablets of the number of those born under the common heathen doom
whom he had snatched, by a holy drop, from the jaws of hell.</p>

<p>Baffled in all his nearly solitary endeavors to check the direful havoc
and wreck of poor humanity on the scenes which were made so gory and
hateful, Las Casas returned again to Spain in 1515, buoyed by resolve and
hope that his dark revelations and bold remonstrances would draw forth
something more effective from the sovereign. He was privileged by free
and sympathizing interviews with Ferdinand at Placentia. But any hope
of success here was soon crushed by the monarch’s death. Las Casas was
intending to go at once to Flanders to plead with the new King, Charles I.,
afterward Emperor, but was delayed by sympathetic friends found in Cardinal
Ximenes and Adrian, the Regents.</p>

<p>It may seem strange and unaccountable that Las Casas should have
encountered near the Court of a benignant sovereign a most malignant
opposition to all his endeavors from first to last in securing the simply humane
objects of his mission. But in fact he was withstood as resolutely at home
as abroad, and often by a more wily and calculating policy. He found
enemies and effective thwarters of his influence and advice in the order of
the Jeronymites. Of the grounds and methods of their harmful activity,
as well as of some of the more ostensible and plausible of the motives and
alleged reasons which made him personal enemies both in Spain and in the
Indies, we must speak with some detail farther on. It may be well here
to follow him summarily in his frequent alternation between his missionary
fields and his homeward voyages, to ply his invigorated zeal with new and
intenser earnestness from his fuller experiences of the woes and outrages
which he sought to redress. With some, though insufficient, assurances
of regal authority in support of his cause, he re-embarked for the Indies,
Nov. 11, 1516, and reached Hispaniola in December, fortified with the personal
title of the “Universal Protector of the Indians.” He sailed again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
for Spain, May 7, 1517. His plainness of speech had in the interval increased
the animosity and the efforts to thwart him of the local authorities
on the islands, and had even induced coldness and lack of aid among his
Dominican friends. He had many public and private hearings in Spain,
stirring up against himself various plottings and new enemies. In each of
these homeward visits Las Casas of course brought with him revelations
and specific details of new accumulations of iniquity against the natives;
and with a better understanding of himself, and also of all the intrigues and
interests warring against him, his honest soul assured him that he must at
last win some triumph in his most righteous cause. So he heaped the
charges and multiplied the disclosures which gave such vehemence and
eloquence to his pleadings. Having during each of his home visits met
some form of misrepresentation or falsehood, he would re-embark, furnished
as he hoped with some new agency and authority against the evil-doers.
But his enemies were as ingenious and as active as himself. Perhaps the
same vessel or fleet which carried him to the islands, with orders intended
to advance his influence, would bear fellow-passengers with documents or
means to thwart all his reinforced mission. He left Spain again in 1520,
only to cast himself on a new sea of troubles soon inducing him to return.
His sixth voyage carried him this time to the mainland in Mexico, in 1537.
He was in Spain once more in 1539. While waiting here for the return of
the Emperor, he composed six of his many essays upon his one unchanging
theme, all glowing with his righteous indignation, and proffering wise
and plain advice to the monarch. Yet again he crossed the now familiar
ocean to America, in 1544, it being his seventh western voyage, and returned
for the seventh and last time to Spain in 1547. Here were fourteen sea-voyages,
with their perils, privations, and lack of the common appliances and
comforts shared in these days by the rudest mariners. These voyages
were interspersed by countless trips and ventures amid the western islands
and the main, involving twofold, and a larger variety of harassments and
risks, with quakings, hurricanes, and reefs, exposures in open skiffs, and the
privilege of making one’s own charts. But one year short of fifty in the
count out of his lengthened life were spent by this man of noble ardor, of
dauntless soul, and of loving heart in a cause which never brought to him
the joy of an accomplished aim.</p>

<p>Las Casas shared, with a few other men of the most fervent and self-sacrificing
religious zeal, an experience of the deepest inward conviction,
following upon, not originally prompting to, the full consecration of his
life to his devoutest aim. Though he had been ordained to the priesthood
in 1510, he was afterward made to realize that he had not then been the
subject of that profound experience known in the formulas of piety as true
conversion. He dates this personal experience, carrying him to a deeper
devotional consciousness than he had previously realized, to the influence
over him of a faithful lay friend, Pedro de la Renteria, with whom he became
intimate in 1514. To the devout conversation, advice, and example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
of this intimate companion he ascribed his better-informed apprehension
of the radical influences which wrought out the whole system of wrong
inflicted upon the natives. Las Casas himself, like all the other Spaniards,
had a company of Indian servants, who were in effect slaves; and he put
them to work, the benefit of which accrued to himself. A form of servitude
which exceeded all the conditions of plantation slavery had been instituted
by Columbus under the system of so-called <i>repartimientos</i>. It was founded
on the assumption that the Spanish monarch had an absolute proprietary
right over the natives, and could make disposals and allotments of their services
to his Christian subjects, the numbers being proportioned to the rank,
standing, and means of individuals, the meanest Spaniard being entitled
to share in the distribution of these servitors. This allowance made over
to men of the lowest grade of intelligence, character, and humanity, the
absolute and irresponsible power over the life and death of the natives
intrusted to the disposal of masters. Under it were perpetrated cruelties
against which there were no availing remonstrances, and for which there
was no redress. The domestic cattle of civilized men are to be envied
above the human beings who were held under the system of <i>repartimientos</i>,&mdash;tasked,
scourged, tormented, and hunted with bloodhounds, if
they sank under toils and inflictions beyond their delicate constitutions,
or sought refuge in flight.</p>

<p>The slavery which afterward existed in the British Colonies and in these
United States had scarce a feature in common with that which originated
with the Spanish invaders. Las Casas thinks that Ferdinand lived and
died without having had anything like a full apprehension of the enormities
of the system. This, however, was not because efforts were lacking to
inform him of these enormities, or to engage his sovereign intervention to
modify and restrain, if not positively to prohibit, them. As we shall see, the
system was so rooted in the greed and rapacity of the first adventurers here,
who were goaded by passion for power and wealth, that foreign authority
was thwarted in every attempt to overrule it. The most favored advisers of
Ferdinand endeavored at first to keep him in ignorance of the system, and
then, as he obtained partial information about it, to lead him to believe that
it was vitally indispensable to conversion, to colonization, and to remunerative
trade. The Dominican missionaries had, as early as 1501, informed
the monarch of the savage cruelties which the system imposed. All that
they effected was to induce Ferdinand to refer the matter to a council of
jurists and theologians. Some of these were even alleged to have personal
interests in the system of <i>repartimientos</i>; but at any rate they were under
the influence and sway of its most selfish supporters. As the result of their
conference, they persuaded the monarch that the system was absolutely
necessary,&mdash;as, first, the Spaniards themselves were incapable of bodily labor
under a debilitating climate; and second, that the close and dependent
relation under which the natives were thus brought to their masters could
alone insure the possibility of their conversion to the true faith. Ferdinand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
was so far won over to the allowance of the wrong as to issue an ordinance
in its favor; while he sought to limit, restrain, and qualify it by injunctions
which, of course, were futile in their dictation, for operating at a distance,
in islands where sordid personal interests were all on the side of a defiance
of them.</p>

<p>The Clerigo affirms that his own conscience was more startlingly aroused
to a full sense of the wrongs and iniquities of the system of the <i>repartimientos</i>
by his religious friend Renteria. He had previously, of course, so
far as he was himself made the master or guardian in this relation of any
number of the natives, brought his humanity and his ardor for justice into
full exercise. But he was quickened by his friend to the duty of private
and also of bold public protest against the system, and most plainly to
offenders in proportion to the number of the victims which they enthralled
and to the cruelty inflicted upon them. It was not his wont to allow any
timidity or personal regards or temporizing calculations to compel his
silence or to moderate his rebukes. His infirmity rather led him to excess
in impatience and passion in his remonstrances. His bold and denunciatory
preaching&mdash;though it appears that in this, and, as we shall
note, on other occasions of speech and writing, he restrained himself from
using the name of conspicuous offenders&mdash;caused an intense consternation
and excitement. His clerical character barely saved him from personal
violence. He found his hearers obdurate, and utterly beyond the
sway of his protests and appeals. Again, therefore, he turned his face
toward Spain, sustained by the fond assurance that he could so engage
the King’s intervention by his disclosures and rehearsals, that the royal
authority should at this time be effectually exerted against a giant iniquity.
This was his homeward errand in 1515. That even his presence and speech
had had some restraining influence in Cuba, is signified by the fact that
after his withdrawal and during his absence all the wrongs and miseries of
which the natives, wholly impotent to resist, were the victims, ran into
wilder license. The Spaniards kept bloodhounds in training and in hunger,
to scour the woods and thickets and wilderness depths for the despairing
fugitives. Whole families of the natives took refuge in voluntary and
preferred self-destruction.</p>

<p>Two Dominicans of like mind with Las Casas accompanied him on his
errand. Pedro de Cordova, prelate of the Dominicans, was his stanch
friend. The Clerigo reached Seville in the autumn of 1515, and at once
addressed himself to Ferdinand. He found the monarch old and ailing.
The most able and malignant opponent with whose support, enlisted
upon the side of the wrong and of the wrongdoers, Las Casas had to contend,
was the Bishop of Burgos, Fonseca, whose influence had sway in the
Council for the Indies.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> After the King’s death, Jan. 23, 1516, Las Casas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
enjoyed the countenance, and had hope of the effectual aid, of the two Regents,
previously mentioned, during the minority of Charles, the heir to
the throne. The earnestness and persistency of the Clerigo so far availed
as to obtain for him instructions to be carried to those in authority in the
islands for qualifying the <i>repartimiento</i> system, and with penalties for the
oppressions under it. Some Jeronymites were selected to accompany him
on his return, as if to reinforce the objects of his mission, and to insure the
efficacy of the title conferred upon him as the “Protector of the Indians.”
The Jeronymites, however, had been corrupted by the cunning and intrigues
of the wily and exasperated enemies of Las Casas, who effected
in secrecy what they could not or dared not attempt publicly against the
courageous Clerigo and his purposes backed by authority. Already alienated
during the voyage, they reached San Domingo in December, 1516.
Perhaps candor may induce the suggestion that while the Jeronymites, from
motives of prudence, temporized and qualified their activity in their errand,
Las Casas was heady and unforbearing in his uncompromising demand for
instant redress of wrong. At any rate he was wholly foiled in the exercise
of his delegated authority; and so, with a fire in his blood which allowed
no peace to his spirit, he was again in Spain in July, 1517. Here he found
Cardinal Ximenes, his friendly patron, near to death. He was, however,
encouraged with the hope and promise of patronage from high quarters.
For a season his cause presented a favorable aspect. He had become
sadly assured that upon the Spaniards in the islands, whose hearts and
consciences were smothered by their greed and inhumanity, no influence,
not even that of ghostly terrorism, which was tried in the refusal of the
sacraments, would be of the least avail. His only resource was to engage
what force there might be in the piety and humanity of the Church at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
home, in the sense of justice among high civil dignitaries, and in such
sympathetic aid as he might draw from his countrymen who had no interest
in the mining or the commerce sustained by the impositions upon
the natives. The young King had wise councillors, and they made with
him some good plans for means of relieving the natives from severities
in their tasks of labor, from cruel inflictions in working the mines, and from
exorbitant taxes exacting of them produce and commodities enormously
exceeding their possible resources, however willing they might be in yielding.
It was at this time and under its emergency, that Las Casas unfortunately
gave something more than his assent, even his countenance and
advice, to a proposition the effect of which was to root in pure and free
soil an enormity whose harvesting and increase were a sum of woes. He
certainly did advise that each Spaniard, resident in Hispaniola, should
be allowed to import a dozen negro slaves. He did this, as he afterward
affirmed and confessed, under the lure of a deep mist and delusion.
So painful was the remorse which he then experienced for his folly and
error, that he avows that he would part with all he had in the world to
redress it. He says that when he gave this advice he had not at all been
aware of the outrages perpetrated by the Portuguese dealers in entrapping
these wretched Africans. Besides this, he had been promised by the colonists
that if they might be allowed to have negroes, whose constitutions
were stronger for endurance, they would give up the feeble natives. We
may therefore acquit Las Casas in his confessed sin of ignorance and willing
compromise in an alternative of wrongs. But he is wholly guiltless of
a charge which has been brought against him, founded upon this admitted
error, of having been the first to propose and to secure the introduction of
African slavery into the New World. As has already been said, the wrong
had been perpetrated many years before Las Casas had any agency in it
by deed or word. While the young King was still in Flanders negro slaves
had been sent by his permission to Hispaniola. The number was limited
to a thousand for each of the four principal islands. As there was a monopoly
set up in the sale of these doleful victims, the price of them was
speedily and greatly enhanced.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>Las Casas devised and initiated a scheme for the emigration of laboring
men from Spain. Thwarted in this purpose, he formed a plan for a colony
where restrictions were to be enforced to guard against the worst abuses.
Fifty Spaniards, intended to be carefully selected with regard to character
and habits, and distinguished by a semi-clerical garb and mode of life,
were his next device for introducing some more tolerable conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
work and thrift in the islands. Ridicule was brought to bear, with all sorts
of intrigues and tricks, to baffle this scheme. But the Clerigo persevered
in meeting all the obstructions thrown in his way, and sailed for San Domingo
in July, 1520. He established his little Utopian colony at Cumana;
but misadventures befel it, and it came to a melancholy end. It seemed
for a season as if the tried and patient Clerigo was at last driven to complete
disheartenment. Wearied and exhausted, he took refuge in a Dominican
convent in San Domingo, receiving the tonsure in 1522. Here he
was in retirement for eight years, occupying himself in studying and writing,
of which we have many results. During this interval the work of depopulation
and devastation was ruinously advancing under Cortés, Alvarado,
and Pizarro, in Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru. There is some uncertainty
about an alleged presence of Las Casas at the Court in Spain in 1530.
But he was in Mexico in 1531, in Nicaragua in 1534, and in Spain again
in 1539, in behalf of a promising work undertaken in Tuzulutlan, from
which all lay Spaniards were to be excluded. Having accomplished, as
he hoped, the object of his visit, he would have returned at once to the
American main; but was detained by the Council of the Indies as the person
best able and most trustworthy to give them certain information which
they desired. It was at this period that he wrote his remarkable work,
<i>The Destruction of the Indies</i>. This bold and daring product of his pen
and of the righteous indignation which had heretofore found expression
from his eloquent and fervid speech, will soon be examined in detail. It
may be said now that this work, afterward so widely circulated and translated
into all the languages of Europe,&mdash;perhaps with some reductions
from the original,&mdash;was not at first allowed to be published, but was submitted
to the Emperor and his ministers. As the shocking revelations
made in this book state in round numbers the victims of the Spaniards in
different places, it is at once observable that there are over-statements and
exaggerations. This, however, applies only to the numbers, not at all to the
acts of barbarity and iniquity.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> The book was published twelve years after
it was written, and was dedicated to Philip, the heir to the throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be as well here to complete the summary of the career of Las
Casas. While detained by the Council he was engaged in the advice and
oversight of a new code of laws for the government of the colonies and
the colonists. Up to this time he had crossed the ocean to the islands
or the main twelve times, and had journeyed to Germany four times to
confer with the Emperor. He was offered the bishopric of Cusco, in Toledo,
but was not thus to be withdrawn from his foreign mission. In order,
however, to secure authority to enforce the new laws, he accepted the foreign
bishopric of Chiapa, was consecrated at Seville in 1544, embarked
on July 4, with forty-four monks, and arrived at Hispaniola. He bore the
aversion and hate which his presence everywhere provoked, was faithful to
the monastic habits, and though so abstemious as to deny himself meat, he
kept the vigor of his body. He resolutely forbade absolution to be given
to Spaniards holding slaves contrary to the provisions of the new laws.
Resigning his bishopric, he returned to Spain for the last time in 1547,&mdash;engaging
in his bold controversy with Sepulveda, to be soon rehearsed.
He resided chiefly in the Dominican College at Valladolid. In 1564, in
his ninetieth year, he wrote a work on Peru. On a visit to Madrid in the
service of the Indians, after a short illness, he died in July, 1566, at the age
of ninety-two, and was buried in the convent of “Our Lady of Atocha.”</p>

<p class="p2">The most resolute and effective opponents which Las Casas found at the
Spanish Court were Oviedo and Sepulveda, representatives of two different
classes of those who from different motives and by different methods stood
between him and the King. Oviedo had held high offices under Government
both in Spain and in various places in the New World. He wrote
a history of the Indies, which Las Casas said was as full of lies almost as
of pages. He also had large interests in the mines and in the enslaving
of the natives. Sepulveda<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> was distinguished as a scholar and an author.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Las Casas charges that his pen and influence were engaged in the interest
of parties who had committed some of the greatest ravages, and who had
personal advantages at stake. Sepulveda in his opposition to the Clerigo
makes two points or “Conclusions,”&mdash;1. That the Spaniards had a right
to subjugate and require the submission of the Indians, because of their
superior wisdom and prudence; and that, therefore, the Indians were bound
to submit and acquiesce. 2. That in case of their refusal to do so they
might justly be constrained by force of arms. It was the proceeding on
these assumptions that, as Las Casas pleaded, had led to the entire depopulation
of vast territories. With high professions of loyalty Sepulveda
urged that his motive in writing was simply to justify the absolute
title of the King of Spain to the Indies. In offering his book to the Royal
Council he importunately solicited its publication; and as this was repeatedly
refused, he engaged the urgency of his friends to bring it about. Las
Casas, well knowing what mischief it would work, strongly opposed the
publication. The Council, regarding the matter as purely theological,
referred Sepulveda’s treatise for a thorough examination to the universities
of Salamanca and Alcala. They pronounced it unsound in doctrine
and unfit to be printed. Sepulveda then secretly sent it to Rome, and
through his friend, the Bishop of Segovia, procured it to be printed. The
Emperor prohibited its circulation in Spain, and caused the copies of it
to be seized.</p>

<p>Las Casas resolved to refute this dangerous treatise, and Sepulveda
was personally cited to a dispute, which was continued through five days.
As a result, the King’s confessor, Dominic de Soto, an eminent divine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
was asked to give a summary of the case. This he did in substance as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The prime point is whether the Emperor may justly make war on the Indians
before the Faith has been preached to them, and whether after being subdued by
arms they will be in any condition to receive the light of the Gospel, more tractable,
more docile to good impressions, and ready to give up their errors. The issue between
the disputants was, that Sepulveda maintained that war was not only lawful and allowable,
but necessary; while Las Casas insisted upon the direct contrary,&mdash;that war was
wholly unjust, and offered invincible obstacles to conversion. Sepulveda presented
four arguments on his side: 1. The enormous wickedness and criminality of the
Indians, their idolatry, and their sins against nature. 2. Their ignorance and barbarity
needed the mastery of the intelligent and polite Spaniards. 3. The work of conversion
would be facilitated after subjugation. 4. That the Indians treat each other with
great cruelty, and offer human sacrifices to false gods. Sepulveda fortifies these arguments
by examples and authorities from Scripture, and by the views of doctors and
canonists,&mdash;all proceeding upon the assumed exceeding wickedness of the Indians.
In citing <i>Deuteronomy</i> xx. 10-16, he interprets ‘far-off cities’ as those of a different
religion. Las Casas replies that it was not simply as idolaters that the seven
nations in Canaan were to be destroyed,&mdash;as the same fate, on that score, might have
been visited upon all the inhabitants of the earth, except Israel,&mdash;but as intruders upon
the Promised Land. The early Christian emperors, beginning with Constantine, did not
make their wars as against idolaters, but for political reasons. He cites the Fathers as
giving testimony to the effect of a good example and against violent measures. The
Indians under the light of Nature are sincere, but are blinded in offering sacrifices.
They are not like the worst kind of barbarians, to be hunted as beasts; they have
princes, cities, laws, and arts. It is wholly unjust, impolitic, and futile to wage war
against them as simply barbarians. The Moors of Africa had been Christians in the
time of Augustine, and had been perverted, and so might rightfully be reclaimed.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Royal Council, after listening to the dispute and the summary of its
points, asked Las Casas to draw up a paper on the question whether they
might lawfully enslave the Indians, or were bound to set free all who were
reduced to bondage. He replied that the law of God does not justify war
against any people for the sake of making them Christians; so the whole
course of treatment of the Indians had been wrong from the start. The
Indians were harmless; they had never had the knowledge or the proffer
of Christianity: so they had never fallen away, like the Moors of Africa,
Constantinople, and Jerusalem. No sovereign prince had authorized the
Spaniards to make war. The Spaniards cannot pretend that their reason
for making war was because of the cruelty of the Indians to each other.
The slaughter of them was indiscriminate and universal. They were enslaved
and branded with the King’s arms. The monarch never authorized
these execrable artifices and shocking atrocities, a long catalogue of which
is specified.</p>

<p>The Clerigo then warms into an earnest dissertation on natural and Christian
equity. He quotes some beautiful sentences from the will of Isabella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
enjoining her own humanity on her husband and daughter. He makes a
strong point of the fact that Isabella first, and then a council of divines and
lawyers at Burgos, and Charles himself in 1523, had declared that all the inhabitants
of the New World had been born free. Only Las Casas’ earnestness,
his pure and persistent purpose, relieve of weariness his reiteration of
the same truths and appeals to the King. He insists over and over again
that the delegating of any portion of the King’s own personal authority to any
Spaniard resident in the New World, or even to the Council of the Indies,
opens the door to every form and degree of abuse, and that he must strictly
reserve all jurisdiction and control to himself.</p>

<p>In a second treatise, which Las Casas addressed to Charles V., he states
at length the practical measures needful for arresting the wrongs and disasters
consequent upon the enslaving of the Indians. Of the twenty methods
specified, the most important is that the King should not part with the least
portion of his sovereign prerogative. He meets the objection artfully raised
by Sepulveda, that if the King thus retains all authority to himself he may
lose the vast domain to his crown, and that the Spaniards will be forced to
return to Europe and give up the work of Gospel conversion.</p>

<p>Las Casas wrote six memorials or argumentative treatises addressed to
the sovereigns on the one same theme. The sameness of the information and
appeals in them is varied only by the increasing boldness of the writer in
exposing iniquities, and by the warmer earnestness of his demand for the
royal interposition. His sixth treatise is a most bold and searching exposition
of the limits of the royal power over newly discovered territory, and
within the kingdoms and over the natural rights of the natives. A copy
of this paper was obtained by a German ambassador in Spain, and published
at Spire, in Latin, in 1571. It is evident that for a considerable period after
the composition&mdash;and, so to speak, the publication&mdash;of these successive protests
and appeals of the Clerigo, only a very limited circulation was gained
by them. Artful efforts were made, first to suppress them, and then to
confine the knowledge of the facts contained in them to as narrow a range
as possible. His enemies availed themselves of their utmost ingenuity and
cunning to nullify his influence. Sometimes he was ridiculed as a crazy
enthusiast,&mdash;a visionary monomaniac upon an exaggerated delusion of
his own fancy. Again, he would be gravely and threateningly denounced
as an enemy to Church and State, because he imperilled the vast interests
of Spain in her colonies.</p>

<p>The principal and most important work from the pen of Las Casas, on
which his many subsequent writings are based and substantially developed,
bears (in English) the following title: <i>A Relation of the First Voyages and
Discoveries made by the Spaniards in America. With an Account of their
Unparalleled Cruelties on the Indians, in the Destruction of above Forty Millions
of People; together with the Propositions offered to the King of Spain
to prevent the further Ruin of the West Indies. By Don Bartholomew de
las Casas, Bishop of Chiapa, who was an Eye-witness of their Cruelties.</i> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
was composed in Spanish, and finished at Valencia, Dec. 8, 1542, near
the beginning of the reign of Philip II., to whom it is dedicated. This was
about fifty years after the discovery of America; and during the greater
part of the period Las Casas had lived as an observer of the scenes and
events which he describes. He makes Hispaniola his starting-point, as
the navigators usually first touched there. The reader will at once be
struck by the exaggeration, the effect of a high-wrought and inflamed imagination,
so evident in the words of the title, which set the number of the
victims of Spanish cruelty at forty millions. Of this weakness of Las Casas
in over-estimate and exaggeration of numbers, we shall have to take special
notice by and by. It is enough to say here that his license in this direction
is confined to this one point, and is by no means to be viewed as discrediting
his integrity, fidelity, and accuracy in other parts of his testimony.
He certainly had been deeply impressed with the density of the population
in some of the islands, for he says: “It seems as if Providence had amassed
together the greatest part of mankind in this region of the earth.” He tells
us that his motives for writing and publishing his exposure of iniquities
were,&mdash;the call made upon him by pious and Christian people thus to enlist
the sympathies and efforts of the good to redress the wrong; and his sincere
attachment to his King and Master, lest God should avenge the wrong
on his kingdom. For this purpose he has followed the Court with his
pleadings, and will not cease his remonstrances and appeals. At the time
of completing his work savage cruelties were prevailing over all the parts of
America which had been opened, slightly restrained for the time in Mexico,
through the stern intervention of the King. An addition to his work in
1546 recognized many new ordinances and decrees made by his Majesty
at Barcelona since 1542, and signed at Madrid in 1543. But nevertheless
a new field for oppression and wickedness had been opened in Peru, with
exasperations from civil war and rebellion among the natives; while the
Spaniards on most frivolous pretexts defied the orders of the King, pretending
to wait for his answers to their pleas in self-justification. The
period was one in which the rapacity of the invaders was both inflamed
and gratified by abundance of spoil, which sharpened the avarice of the
earlier claimants, and drew to them fresh adventurers.</p>

<p>Las Casas gives a very winning description of the natives under his
observation and in his ever-kindly and sympathetic relations with them.
He says they are simple, humble, patient, guileless, submissive, weak, and
effeminate; incapable of toil or labor, short-lived, succumbing to slight
illnesses; as frugal and abstemious as hermits; inquisitive about the Catholic
religion, and docile disciples. They were lambs who had encountered
tigers, wolves, and lions. During the lifetime of Las Casas Cuba had been
rendered desolate and a desert; then St. John and Jamaica; and in all thirty
islands had come to the same fate. A system of deportation from one
island to another had been devised to obtain new supplies of slaves. The
Clerigo deliberately charges that in forty years the number of victims counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to fifty millions. Enslaving was but a protracted method of killing,&mdash;all in
the greed for gold and pearls. The sight of a fragment of the precious metal
in the hands of a native was the occasion for demanding more of him, as if
he had hidden treasure, or for his guiding the Spaniards to some real or
imagined mines. Las Casas follows his details and examples of iniquity
through the islands in succession, then through the provinces of Nicaragua,
New Spain, Guatemala, Pannco, Jalisco, Yucatan, St. Martha, Carthagena,
the Pearl Coast, Trinidad, the River Yuya-pari, Venezuela, Florida, La Plata,
and Peru,&mdash;being in all seventeen localities,&mdash;repeating the similar facts,
hardly with variations. Against the Spaniards with their horses, lances,
swords, and bloodhounds, the natives could oppose only their light spears and
poisoned arrows. The victims would seek refuge in caves and mountain fastnesses,
and if approached would kill themselves, as the easiest escape from
wanton tortures. Las Casas says: “I one day saw four or five persons, of the
highest rank, in Hispaniola, burned by a slow fire.” Occasionally, he tells us,
a maddened Indian would kill a Spaniard, and then his death would be
avenged by the massacre of a score or a hundred natives. Immediately
upon the knowledge of the death of Isabella, in 1504, as if her humanity
had been some restraint, the barbarous proceedings were greatly intensified.
The Spaniards made the most reckless waste of the food of the natives.
Las Casas says: “One Spaniard will consume in a day the food of three
Indian families of ten persons each for a month.” He avows that when he
wrote there were scarce two hundred natives left in St. John and Jamaica,
where there had once been six hundred thousand. For reasons of caution
or prudence&mdash;we can hardly say from fear, for never was there a more
courageous champion&mdash;Las Casas suppresses the names of the greatest
offenders. The following are specimens of his method: “Three merciless
tyrants have invaded Florida, one after another, since 1510.” “A Spanish
commander with a great number of soldiers entered Peru,” etc. “In the
year 1514 a merciless governor, destitute of the least sentiment of pity or
humanity, a cruel instrument of the wrath of God, pierced into the continent.”
“The fore-mentioned governor,” etc. “The captain whose lot it was to
travel into Guatemala did a world of mischief there.” “The first bishop
that was sent into America imitated the conduct of the covetous governors
in enslaving and spoiling.” “They call the countries they have got by their
unjust and cruel wars their conquests.” “No tongue is capable of describing
to the life all the horrid villanies perpetrated by these bloody-minded
men. They seemed to be the declared enemies of mankind.” The more
generous the presents in treasures which were made by some timid cacique
to his spoilers, the more brutally was he dealt with, in the hope of extorting
what he was suspected of having concealed. Las Casas stakes his veracity
on the assertion: “I saw with my own eyes above six thousand children die
in three or four months.”</p>

<p>To reinforce his own statements the Clerigo quotes letters from high
authorities. One is a protest which the Bishop of St. Martha wrote in 1541<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to the King of Spain, saying that “the Spaniards live there like devils,
rather than Christians, violating all the laws of God and man.” Another is
from Mark de Xlicia, a Franciscan friar, to the King, the General of his
Order, who came with the first Spaniards into Peru, testifying from his eyesight
to all enormities, in mutilations, cutting off the noses, ears, and hands
of the natives, burning and tortures, and keeping famished dogs to chase
them.</p>

<p>Las Casas follows up his direful catalogue of horrors into the “New
Kingdom of Grenada,” in 1536, which he says received its name from the
native place of “the captain that first set his foot in it.” Those whom he
took with him into Peru were “very profligate and extremely cruel men,
without scruple or remorse, long accustomed to all sorts of wickedness.”
The second “governor,” enraged that his predecessor had got the first share
of the plunder, though enough was left for spoil, turned informer, and made
an exposure of his atrocities in complaints to the Council of the Indies, in
documents which “are yet to be seen.” The spoils were prodigious quantities
of gold and precious stones, especially emeralds. The “governor”
seized and imprisoned the cacique, or inca, Bogata, requiring him to send
for and gather up all the gold within his reach; and after heaps of it had
been brought, put him to horrid torture in order to extort more.</p>

<p>There were published at Madeira certain “Laws and Constitutions”
made by the King at Barcelona, in 1542, under the influence of Las Casas,
as the result of a council at Valladolid. Strict orders to put a stop to the
iniquitous proceedings were circumvented by agents sent in the interest of
the authors of the outrages. The Clerigo petitioned the King to constitute
all the natives his free subjects, with no delegated lordship over them, and
enjoined upon him “to take an oath on the Holy Gospels, for himself and
his successors, to this effect, and to put it in his will, solemnly witnessed.”
He insists that this is the only course to prevent the absolute extermination
of the natives. He adds that the Spaniards in their covetousness combine
to keep out priests and monks, not the slightest attempt being made
to convert the natives, though the work would be easy, and they themselves
crave it. “The Spaniards have no more regard to their salvation than if
their souls and bodies died together, and were incapable of eternal rewards
or punishments.” Yet he admits that it would hardly be reasonable to
expect these efforts for conversion of the heathen from men who are themselves
heathen, and so ignorant and brutish that they “do not know even
the number of the commandments.” “As for your Majesty,” the Clerigo
says, with a keen thrust, “the Indians think you are the most cruel and
impious prince in the world, while they see the cruelty and impiety your
subjects so insolently commit, and they verily believe your Majesty lives
upon nothing but human flesh and blood.” He positively denies the imputations
alleged to justify cruelty,&mdash;that the Indians indulged in abominable
lusts against nature, and were cannibals. As for their idolatry, that is a sin
against God, for Him, not for man, to punish. The monarchs, he insists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
had been most artfully imposed upon in allowing the deportation of natives
from the Lucay Islands to supply the havoc made in Hispaniola. The
Clerigo goes into the most minute details, with specifications and reiterations
of horrors, ascribing them to the delegated authority exercised by
petty officers, under the higher ones successively intrusted with power.
There is a holy fervor of eloquence in his remonstrances and appeals to his
Majesty to keep the sole power in his own hands, as he reminds him that
fearful retributive judgments from God may be visited upon his own kingdom.
The Council of the Indies, he says, had desired him to write to the
monarch about the exact nature of the right of the kings of Spain to the
Indies; and he intimates that the zeal which he had shown in exposing
iniquities under those whom the King had put in authority in the New
World had been maliciously turned into a charge that he had questioned
the royal title to those regions. As will appear, Las Casas, under the leadings
of that intelligent search for the fundamentals of truth and righteousness
which a quickened conscience had prompted, found his way to the
principles of equity on this subject.</p>

<p>He had, therefore, previously sent to the King thirty well-defined and
carefully stated “Propositions,” which he regards as so self-evident that he
makes no attempt to argue or prove them. His enemies have in view to
cover up their iniquities by misleading the King. Therefore, for conscience’
sake, and under a sense of obligation to God, he sets himself to a sacred
task. Little foreseeing that his life and labor were to be protracted till he
had nearly doubled his years, he says that, finding himself “growing old,
being advanced to the fiftieth year of his age,” and “from a full acquaintance
with America,” his testimony shall be true and clear.</p>

<p>His subtle enemies plead against him that the King has a right to
establish himself in America by force of arms, however ruthless the process,&mdash;quoting
the examples of Nimrod, Alexander, the old Romans, and
the Turks. They allege also that the Spaniards have more prudence and
wisdom than other peoples, and that their country is nearest to the
Indies. He therefore announces his purpose to put himself directly before
the King, and stand for his “Propositions,” which he sends in advance
in writing, suggesting that if it be his Majesty’s pleasure, they be translated
into Latin and published in that language, as well as in Spanish.</p>

<p>The “Propositions” may be stated in substance as follows; they were
keenly studied and searched by those who were anxious to detect flaws or
heresies in them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">1. The Pope derives from Christ authority and power extending over all men,
believers or infidels, in matters pertaining to salvation and eternal life. But these
should be exercised differently over infidels and those who have had a chance to be
believers.</p>

<p>2. This prerogative of the Pope puts him under a solemn obligation to propagate
the Gospel, and to offer it to all infidels who will not oppose it.</p>

<p>3. The Pope is obliged to send capable ministers for this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Christian princes are his most proper and able helpers in it.</p>

<p>5. The Pope may exhort and even oblige Christian princes to this work, by
authority and money, to remove obstructions and to send true workers.</p>

<p>6. The Pope and princes should act in accord and harmony.</p>

<p>7. The Pope may distribute infidel provinces among Christian princes for this
work.</p>

<p>8. In this distribution should be had in view the instruction, conversion, and
interests of the infidels themselves, not the increase of honors, titles, riches, and
territories of the princes.</p>

<p>9. Any incidental advantage which princes may thus gain is allowable; but temporal
ends should be wholly subordinate, the paramount objects being the extending
of the Church, the propagation of the Faith, and the service of God.</p>

<p>10. The lawful native kings and rulers of infidel countries have a right to the
obedience of their subjects, to make laws, etc., and ought not to be deprived,
expelled, or violently dealt with.</p>

<p>11. To transgress this rule involves injustice and every form of wrong.</p>

<p>12. Neither these native rulers nor their subjects should be deprived of their lands
for their idolatry, or any other sin.</p>

<p>13. No tribunal or judge in the world has a right to molest these infidels for
idolatry or any other sins, however enormous, while still infidels, and before they
have voluntarily received baptism, unless they directly oppose, refuse, and resist the
publication of the Gospel.</p>

<p>14. Pope Alexander VI., under whom the discovery was made, was indispensably
obliged to choose a Christian prince to whom to commit these solemn obligations
of the Gospel.</p>

<p>15. Ferdinand and Isabella had especial claims and advantages for this intrustment
by the Pope above all other Catholic princes, because they had with noble
efforts driven out the infidels and Mohammedans from the land of their ancestors,
and because they sent at their own charge Columbus, the great discoverer, whom
they named the chief admiral.</p>

<p>16. As the Pope did right in this assignment, so he has power to revoke it, to
transfer the country to some other prince, and to forbid, on pain of excommunication,
any rival prince to send missionaries.</p>

<p>17. The kings of Castile and Leon have thus come lawfully to jurisdiction over
the Indies.</p>

<p>18. This obliges the native kings of the Indies to submit to the jurisdiction of the
kings of Spain.</p>

<p>19. Those native kings, having freely and voluntarily received the Faith and
baptism, are bound (as they were not before) to acknowledge this sovereignty of the
kings of Spain.</p>

<p>20. The kings of Spain are bound by the law of God to choose and send fit
missionaries to exhort, convert, and do everything for this cause.</p>

<p>21. They have the same power and jurisdiction over these infidels before their
conversion as the Pope has, and share his obligations to convert them.</p>

<p>22. The means for establishing the Faith in the Indies should be the same as those
by which Christ introduced his religion into the world,&mdash;mild, peaceable, and charitable;
humility; good examples of a holy and regular way of living, especially over
such docile and easy subjects; and presents bestowed to win them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>23. Attempts by force of arms are impious, like those of Mahometans, Romans,
Turks, and Moors: they are tyrannical, and unworthy of Christians, calling out blasphemies;
and they have already made the Indians believe that our God is the most
unmerciful and cruel of all Gods.</p>

<p>24. The Indians will naturally oppose the invasion of their country by a title of
conquest, and so will resist the work of conversion.</p>

<p>25. The kings of Spain have from the first given and reiterated their orders against
war and the ill-treatment of the Indians. If any officers have shown commissions and
warrants for such practices, they have been forged or deceptive.</p>

<p>26. So all wars and conquests which have been made have been unjust and tyrannical,
and in effect null; as is proved by proceedings on record in the Council against
such tyrants and other culprits, who are amenable to judgment.</p>

<p>27. The kings of Spain are bound to reinforce and establish those Indian laws
and customs which are good&mdash;and such are most of them&mdash;and to abolish the bad;
thus upholding good manners and civil policy. The Gospel is the method for effecting
this.</p>

<p>28. The Devil could not have done more mischief than the Spaniards have done in
distributing and spoiling the countries, in their rapacity and tyranny; subjecting the
natives to cruel tasks, treating them like beasts, and persecuting those especially who
apply to the monks for instruction.</p>

<p>29. The distribution of the Indians among the Spaniards as slaves is wholly contrary
to all the royal orders given by Isabella successively to Columbus, Bobadilla, and
De Lares. Columbus gave three hundred Indians to Spaniards who had done the
most service to the Crown, and took but one for his own use. The Queen ordered all
except that one to be sent back. What would she have said to the present iniquities?
The King is reminded that his frequent journeys and absences have prevented his
fully informing himself of these facts.</p>

<p>30. From all these considerations it follows that all conquests, acquisitions, usurpations,
and appropriations by officers and private persons have no legality, as contrary
to the orders of the Spanish monarchs.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Here certainly is an admirable and cogent statement of the principles of
equity and righteousness, as based upon natural laws and certified and fortified
by the great verities and sanctions supposed to be held in reverence by
professed Christians. Las Casas, in taking for his starting-point the Pope’s
supreme and inclusive right over half the globe, just brought to the knowledge
of civilized men, seems to make a monstrous assumption, only greater
than that of the Spanish kings’ holding under and deriving dominion from
him. But we may well pardon this assumption to so loyal a disciple of the
Church, when we consider how nobly he held this Papal right as conditioned
and limited, involving lofty duties, and balanced by an obligation
to confer inestimable blessings. He had ever before him the contrast
between fair scenes of luxurious Nature, ministering to the easy happiness
of a gentle race of delicate and short-lived beings akin to himself, and the
ruthless passions, lusts, and savagery of his own countrymen and fellow-Christians.
We can well account for the opposition and thwarting of his
efforts amid these scenes, but may need a further explanation of the resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and ill-success which he encountered when pleading his cause
before monarchs and great councillors at home, whose sympathies seem
to have been generally on his side. He often stood wholly alone in scenes
where these ravaging cruelties had full sweep,&mdash;alone in the humane sensitiveness
with which he regarded them; alone in freedom from the mastering
passions of greed and rapacity which excited them; and alone in
realizing the appalling contrast between the spirit of blood and rapine which
prompted them, and the spirit of that Gospel, the assumed championship of
which at these ends of the earth was the blasphemous pretence of these
murderers. Those ruthless tyrants, who here treated hundreds and thousands
of the natives subject to them worse than even brutes from which
useful service is expected, would not, of course, have the front to offer on
the spot the pretence set up for them by their abetters at the Spanish
Court,&mdash;that they were thus drawing the natives to them for their conversion;
they laughed at the Clerigo when they did not openly thwart him.</p>

<p>Las Casas had many powerful and embittered opponents, and by the
use of various means and artifices they were able to put impediments in
his way, to qualify and avert what would seem to be the natural effects of
his ardent appeals and shocking disclosures, and to keep him through his
protracted life in what looked like a hopeless struggle against giant iniquities.
Nor is it necessary that we go deeper than the obvious surface of
the story to find the reasons for the opposition and discomfiture which he
encountered. It may be that all those who opposed him or who would not
co-operate with him were not personally interested in the iniquities which
he exposed and sought to redress. Something may need to be said by
and by concerning alleged faults of temper, over-ardor of zeal and overstatement,
and wild exaggeration attributed to this bold apostle of righteousness.
But that the substance of all his charges, and the specifications
of inhumanity, cruelty, and atrocity which he set forth in detail, and with
hardly enough diversity to vary his narrative, is faithful to the soberest truth,
cannot be questioned. He spoke and wrote of what he had seen and
known. He had looked upon sights of shocking and enormous iniquity
and barbarity, over every scene which he had visited in his unresting
travel. His sleep by night had been broken by the piteous shrieks of
the wretched victims of slow tortures.</p>

<p>Much help may be derived by a reader towards a fuller appreciation of
the character and life-work of Las Casas from the biography of him and
the translation and editing of his principal writings by his ardent admirer,
Llorente.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> This writer refers to a previous abridged translation of the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of Las Casas, published in Paris in 1642. His own edition in French, in
1822, is more full, though somewhat condensed and reconstructed. He
remarks justly upon the prolixity of Las Casas, his long periods, his repetitions,
his pedantic quotations from Scripture and the Latin authors, as the
results of his peripatetic training. His translator and editor credits to the
magnanimity and nobleness of nature of Las Casas the omission of the
names of great offenders in connection with the terrible wrongs done by
them. This reserve of Las Casas has been already referred to. But Llorente,
in seventeen critical notes, answering to the same number of divisions
in the <i>Relation</i> of Las Casas, supplies the names of the leading criminals;
and he also gives in a necrology the shocking or tragic elements and the
dates of the death of these “men of blood.” He adds to the “Remedies”
which Las Casas had suggested to Charles V. the whole additional series of
measures proposed up to 1572. Llorente says that, admitting that the starting-point
in the Thirty Propositions of Las Casas,&mdash;namely, the assumption
of the Papal prerogative as to new-discovered territory,&mdash;was in his day
“incontestable,” it is now recognized as a falsity. He furnishes an essay of
his own upon the right and wrong of the claim; and he adds to that of
Las Casas a treatise on the limits of the sovereign power of the King. Paw
first, and then Raynal and Robertson, had brought the charge against Las
Casas of having first introduced African slavery into the New World. As
we have seen, the charge was false. Gregoire, bishop of Blois, read an
<i>Apologie</i> before the Institute of France in 1801, in vindication of the Clerigo.
This <i>Apologie</i> is given at length by Llorente. He adds, from manuscripts
in the Royal Library of Paris, two inedited treatises of Las Casas, written
in 1555-1564,&mdash;one against a project for perpetuating the <i>commanderies</i>
in the New World; the other on the necessity of restoring the crown of
Peru to the Inca Titus.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Llorente says it is not strange that the apostle Las Casas, like other
great and noble men, met with enemies and detractors. Some assailed him
through prejudice, others merely from levity, and without reflection. Four
principal reproaches have been brought against him:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. He is charged with gross exaggeration in his writings, as by the
Spanish writers Camporicanes, Nuix, and Muñoz, and of course by those
interested in excusing the work of conquest and devastation, who cannot
justify themselves without impeaching Las Casas as an impostor. His
sufficient vindication from this charge may be found in a mass of legal documents
in the Archives, in the Records of the Council for the Indies, and in
Government processes against wrongdoers. Herrera, who had seen these
documents, says: “Las Casas was worthy of all confidence, and in no particular
has failed to present the truth.” Torquemada, having personally
sought for evidence in America, says the same. Las Casas, when challenged
on this point, boldly affirmed: “There were once more natives in Hispaniola
than in all Spain,” and that Cuba, Jamaica, and forty other islands, with
parts of Terra Firma, had all been wrecked and made desolate. He insists
over and over again that his estimates are within the truth.</p>

<p>2. Another charge was of imprudence in his ill-considered proceedings
with the Indians. Allowance is to be made on the score of his zeal, his
extreme ardor and vehemence,&mdash;an offset to the apathy and hard-heartedness
of those around him. He was in a position in which he could do
nothing for the Indians if he kept silence. He witnessed the reckless and
defiant disobedience of the positive instructions of the King by his own
high officers.</p>

<p>3. The third charge was of <i>inconsistency</i> in condemning the enslaving
of Indians, and favoring that of negroes. This has already been disposed
of.</p>

<p>4. The final charge was that he was consumed by ambition. Only a
single writer had the effrontery to ascribe to Las Casas the desperate purpose
of seizing upon the sovereignty of a thousand leagues of territory.
The whole foundation of the charge was his attempt to plant a particular
colony in the province of Cumana, near St. Martha, on Terra Firma. So
far from claiming sovereignty for himself, he even denied the right of the
King to bestow such sovereignty.</p>

<p>He was, says Llorente, blameless; there is no stain upon his great
virtues. Indeed, not only Spain, but all nations, owe him a debt for his
opposition to despotism, and for his setting limits to royal power in the age
of Charles V. and the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Then follows Llorente’s translation into French of Las Casas’ Memoir on
the <i>Cruelties practised on the Indians</i>, with the Dedicatory Letter addressed
to Philip II., 1552. The Spaniards at Hispaniola and elsewhere forgot that
they were men, and treated the innocent creatures around them for forty-two
years as if they were famished wolves, tigers, and lions. So that in
Hispaniola, where once were three millions, there remained not more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
two hundred. Cuba, Porto Rico, and Jamaica had been wholly depopulated.
On more than sixty Lucayan islands, on the smallest of which were once
five hundred thousand natives, Las Casas says, “my own eyes” have seen
but eleven.</p>

<p>These appalling enumerations of the victims of Spanish cruelty during
half a century from the first coming of the invaders to the islands and main
of America, are set before the reader in the figures and estimates of Las
Casas. Of course the instant judgment of the reader will be that there is
obvious and gross exaggeration in them. It remains to this day a debated
and wholly undecided question among archæologists, historians, and explorers
best able to deal with it, as to the number of natives on island and
continent when America was opened to knowledge. There are no facts
within our use for any other mode of dealing with the question than
by estimates, conjectures, and inferences. A reasonable view is that the
southern islands were far more thickly peopled than the main, vast regions
of which, when first penetrated by the whites, were found to be perfect
solitudes. The general tendency now with those who have pursued any
thorough investigations relating to the above question, is greatly to reduce
the number of the aborigines below the guesses and the once-accepted
estimates. Nor does it concern us much to attempt any argument as to the
obvious over-estimates made by Las Casas, or to decide whether they came
from his imagination or fervor of spirit, or whether, as showing himself
incredible in these rash and wild enumerations, he brings his veracity and
trustworthiness under grave doubts in other matters.</p>

<p>Las Casas says that near the Island of San Juan are thirty others without
a single Indian. More than two thousand leagues of territory are wholly
deserted. On the continent ten kingdoms, “each larger than Spain,” with
Aragon and Portugal, are an immense solitude, human life being annihilated
there. He estimates the number of men, women, and children who have been
slaughtered at more than fifteen millions. Generally they were tormented,
no effort having been made to convert them. In vain did the natives, helpless
with their feeble weapons, hide their women and children in the mountains.
When, maddened by desperation, they killed a single Spaniard, vengeance
was taken by the score. The Clerigo, as if following the strictest process
of arithmetic, gives the number of victims in each of many places, only
with variations and aggravations. He asserts that in Cuba, in three or four
months, he had seen more than seven thousand children perish of famine,
their parents having been driven off to the mines. He adds that the worst
of the cruelties in Hispaniola did not take place till after the death of
Isabella, and that efforts were made to conceal from her such as did occur,
as she continued to demand right and mercy. She had done her utmost
to suppress the system of <i>repartimientos</i>, by which the natives were
distributed as slaves to masters.</p>

<p>An inference helpful to an approximate estimate of the numbers and
extent of the depopulation of the first series of islands seized on by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Spaniards, might be drawn from the vast numbers of natives deported from
other groups of islands to replace the waste and to restore laborers.
Geographers have somewhat arbitrarily distinguished the West Indies into
three main groupings of islands,&mdash;the Lucayan, or Bahamas, of fourteen
large and a vast number of small islands, extending, from opposite the coast
of Florida, some seven hundred and fifty miles oceanward; the Greater
Antilles, embracing Cuba, San Domingo, Porto Rico, Jamaica, etc., running,
from opposite the Gulf of Mexico, from farther westward than the other
groups; and the Lesser Antilles, or Carribean, or Windward Islands. The
last-named, from their repute of cannibalism, were from the first coming
of the Spaniards regarded as fair subjects for spoil, violence, and devastation.
After ruin had done its work in the Greater Antilles, recourse was
had to the Lucayan Islands. By the foulest and meanest stratagems for
enticing away the natives of these fair scenes, they were deported in vast
numbers to Cuba and elsewhere as slaves. It was estimated that in five
years Ovando had beguiled and carried off forty thousand natives of the
Lucayan Islands to Hispaniola.</p>

<p>The amiable and highly honored historian, Mr. Prescott, says in general,
of the numerical estimates of Las Casas, that “the good Bishop’s arithmetic
came more from his heart than his head.”<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p>From the fullest examination which I have been able to make, by the
comparison of authorities and incidental facts, while I should most frankly
admit that Las Casas gave even a wild indulgence to his dismay and his
indignation in his figures, I should conclude that he had positive knowledge,
from actual eyesight and observation, of every form and shape, as well as
instance and aggregation, of the cruelties and enormities which aroused his
lifelong efforts. Besides the means and methods used to discredit the statements
and to thwart the appeals of Las Casas at the Court, a very insidious
attempt for vindicating, palliating, and even justifying the acts of violence
and cruelty which he alleged against the Spaniards in the islands and on the
main, was in the charge that their victims were horribly addicted to cannibalism
and the offering of human sacrifices. The number estimated of the
latter as slaughtered, especially on great royal occasions, is appalling, and
the rites described are hideous. It seems impossible for us now, from so
many dubious and conflicting authorities, to reach any trustworthy knowledge
on this subject. For instance, in Anahuac, Mexico, the annual number
of human sacrifices, as stated by different writers, varies from twenty
to fifty thousand. Sepulveda in his contest with Las Casas was bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
make the most of this dismal story, and said that no one of the authorities
estimated the number of the victims at less than twenty thousand. Las
Casas replied that this was the estimate of brigands, who wished thus to win
tolerance for their own slaughterings, and that the actual number of annual
victims did not exceed twenty.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> It was a hard recourse for Christians to
seek palliation for their cruelties in noting or exaggerating the superstitious
and hideous rites of heathens!</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that this plea of cannibalism was most effectively
used, from the first vague reports which Columbus took back to Spain of
its prevalence, at least in the Carribean Islands, to overcome the earliest
humane protests against the slaughter of the natives and their deportation
for slaves. In the all-too hideous engravings presented in the volumes in
all the tongues of Europe exposing the cruelties of the Spanish invaders,
are found revolting delineations of the Indian shambles, where portions of
human bodies, subjected to a fiendish butchery, are exposed for sale.
Las Casas nowhere denies positively the existence of this shocking barbarism.
One might well infer, however, from his pages that he was at least
incredulous as to its prevalence; and to him it would only have heightened
his constraining sense of the solemn duty of professed Christians to
bring the power of the missionary, rather than the maddened violence of
destruction, to bear upon the poor victims of so awful a sin. Nor does the
evidence within our reach suffice to prove the prevalence, to the astounding
extent alleged by the opponents of Las Casas, of monstrous and bestial
crimes against nature practised among the natives. Perhaps a parallel
between the general morality respectively existing in the license and vices
of the invaders and the children of Nature as presented to us by Columbus,
as well as by Las Casas, would not leave matter for boasting to the Europeans.
Mr. Prescott enters into an elaborate examination of a subject of
frequent discussion by American historians and archæologists,&mdash;who have
adopted different conclusions upon it,&mdash;as to whether venereal diseases had
prevalence among the peoples of the New World before it was opened to
the intercourse of foreigners. I have not noticed in anything written by
Las Casas that he brings any charge on this score against his countrymen.
Quite recent exhumations made by our archæologists have seemingly set
the question at rest, by revealing in the bones of our prehistoric races the
evidences of the prevalence of such diseases.</p>

<p>Sufficient means, in hints and incidental statements, have been furnished
in the preceding pages from which the reader may draw his own estimate,
as appreciative and judicious as he may be able to make it, of the character
of Las Casas as a man and as a missionary of Christ. A labored analysis
or an indiscriminating eulogium of that character is wholly uncalled for,
and would be a work of supererogation. His heart and mind, his soul and
body, his life, with all of opportunity which it offered, were consecrated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
his foibles and faults were of the most trivial sort, never leading to injury
for others, and scarcely working any harm for himself.</p>

<p>It is a well-proved and a gladdening truth, that one who stands for the
championship of any single principle involving the rights of humanity will
be led by a kindled vision or a gleam of advanced wisdom to commit
himself to the assumption of some great, comprehensive, illuminating verity
covering a far wider field than that which he personally occupies. Thus
Las Casas’ assertion of the common rights of humanity for the heathen
natives expanded into a bold denial of the fundamental claims of ecclesiasticism.
It was the hope and aim of his opponents and enemies to drive
him to a committal of himself to some position which might be charged
with at least constructive heresy, through some implication or inference
from the basis of his pleadings that he brought under question the authority
of the Papacy. Fonseca and Sepulveda were both bent upon forcing
him into that perilous attitude towards the supreme ecclesiastical power.
To appreciate fully how nearly Las Casas was thought to trespass on the
verge of a heresy which might even have cost him his life, but would
certainly have nullified his personal influence, we must recognize the full
force of the one overmastering assumption, under which the Pope and the
Spanish sovereigns claimed for themselves supreme dominion over territory
and people in the New World. As a new world, or a disclosure on the
earth’s surface of vast realms before unknown to dwellers on the old continents,
its discovery would carry with it the right of absolute ownership and
of rule over all its inhabitants. It was, of course, to be “conquered” and
held in subjection. The earth, created by God, had been made the kingdom
of Jesus Christ, who assigned it to the charge and administration of
his vicegerent, the Pope. All the continents and islands of the earth which
were not Christendom were heathendom. It mattered not what state of
civilization or barbarism, or what form or substance of religion, might be
found in any new-discovered country. The Papal claim was to be asserted
there, if with any need of explanation, for courtesy’s sake, certainly without
any apology or vindication. Could Las Casas be inveigled into any denial
or hesitating allowance of this assumption? He was on his guard, but he
stood manfully for the condition, the supreme obligation, which alone
could give warrant to it. The papal and the royal claims were sound
and good; they were indeed absolute. But the tenure of possession and
authority in heathendom, if it were to be claimed through the Gospel and
the Church, looked quite beyond the control of territory and the lordship
over heathen natives, princes, and people,&mdash;it was simply to prompt the
work and to facilitate, while it positively enjoined the duty of, conversion,&mdash;the
bringing of heathen natives through baptism and instruction into the
fold of Christ. Fonseca and Sepulveda were baffled by the Clerigo as he
calmly and firmly told the monarchs that their prerogative, though lawful
in itself, was fettered by this obligation. In asserting this just condition,
Las Casas effectually disabled his opponents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are the closing sentences of the Reply of Las Casas to
Sepulveda:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The damages and the loss which have befallen the Crown of Castile and Leon
will be visited also upon the whole of Spain, because the tyranny wrought by these
desolations, murders, and slaughters is so monstrous that the blind may see it, the deaf
may hear it, the dumb may rehearse it, and the wise judge and condemn it after our
very short life. I invoke all the hierarchies and choirs of angels, all the saints of the
Celestial Court, all the inhabitants of the globe, and chiefly all those who may live after
me, for witnesses that I free my conscience of all that has transpired; and that I have
fully exposed to his Majesty all these woes; and that if he leaves to Spaniards the
tyranny and government of the Indies, all of them will be destroyed and without
inhabitants,&mdash;as we see that Hispaniola now is, and the other islands and parts of the
continent for more than three thousand leagues, without occupants. For these reasons
God will punish Spain and all her people with an inevitable severity. So may it be!”</p>

<p class="p1">It is grateful to be assured of the fact that during the years of his last
retirement in Spain, till the close of his life at so venerable an age, Las Casas
enjoyed a pension sufficient for his comfortable subsistence. Allowing only
a pittance of it for his own frugal support, he devoted it mostly to works of
charity. His pen and voice and time were still given to asserting and
defending the rights of the natives, not only as human beings, but as free of
all mastery by others. Though his noble zeal had made him enemies, and
he had appeared to have failed in his heroic protests and appeals, he had
the gratification of knowing before his death that restraining measures,
sterner edicts, more faithful and humane officials, and in general a more
wise and righteous policy, had abated the rage of cruelty in the New World.
But still the sad reflection came to qualify even this satisfaction, that the
Spaniards were brought to realize the rights of humanity by learning that
their cruelty had wrought to their own serious loss in depopulating the
most fertile regions and fastening upon them the hate of the remnants of
the people. The reader of the most recent histories, even of the years of
the first quarter of this century, relating to the Spanish missions in the
pueblos of Mexico and California, will note how some of the features of
the old <i>repartimiento</i> system, first introduced among the Greater Antilles,
survived in the farm-lands and among the peons and converts of the
missionaries.</p>

<p>Giving due allowance to what has already been sufficiently recognized as his intensity of
spirit, his wildness of imagination, and his enormous overstatement in his enumeration
of the victims of Spanish cruelty, he must be regarded as the best authority we could have
for the use which he serves to us.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> Free as he was from all selfish and sinister motives,
even the daring assurance with which he speaks out before the monarch and his councillors,
and prints on his titlepages the round numbers of these victims, prompts us to give
full credit to his testimony on other matters, even if we substitute thousands in place of
millions. As to the forms and aggravations of the cruel methods in which the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
dealt with the natives, the recklessness and ingenuity of the work of depopulation,&mdash;which
was as naturally the consequence of the enslaving of the Indians as of their indiscriminate
slaughter,&mdash;Las Casas’ revelations seem to have passed unchallenged by even
his most virulent enemies.</p>

<p>Sepulveda may be received by us as the representative alike in spirit and in argument
of the opposition to Las Casas. He was an acute and able disputant, and would readily
have availed himself of any weak points in the positions of the apostle. It is observable
that, instead of assailing even the vehement and exaggerated charges alleged by Las
Casas against the Spanish marauders for their cruelty, he rather spends his force upon the
maintenance of the abstract rights of Christian champions over the heathen and their
territory. The Papal and the Royal prerogatives were, in his view, of such supreme and
sweeping account in the controversy, as to cover all the incidental consequences of
establishing them. He seemed to argue that heathens and heathenism invited and
justified conquest by any method, however ruthless; that the rights of the Papacy
and of Christian monarchs would be perilled by allowing any regards of sentiment
or humanity to stand in the way of their assertion; and that even the sacred duty of
conversion was to be deferred till war and tyranny had obtained the absolute mastery
over the natives.</p>

<p class="p2">The eight years spent by Las Casas in retirement in the Dominican convent at San
Domingo were used by him in study and meditation. His writings prove, in their references
and quotations from the classics,
as well as from Scripture, that his
range was wide, and that his mind
was invigorated by this training.</p>

<p>In 1552-1553, at Seville, Las
Casas printed a series of nine tracts,
which are the principal source of our
information in relation to his allegations
against the Spanish oppressors
of the Indians. It is only necessary
to refer the reader to the bibliographies<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> for the full titles of these tracts, of which we
simply quote enough for their identification, while we cite them in the order in which they
seem to have been composed, following in this the extensive Note which Field has given
in his <i>Indian Bibliography</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Breuissima relacion de la destruycion de las Indias ... año 1552</i>; 50 unnumbered
leaves.</p>

<p>The series of tracts is usually cited by this title, which is that of the first tract,<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> for
there is no general printed designation of the collection. Four folios appended to this,
but always reckoned as a distinct tract, are called,&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>Lo que se sigue es vn pedaço de vna carta</i>, etc. It records the observations of a
Spanish traveller upon the enormities practised on the natives.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>Entre los remedios ... para reformaciō de las Indias</i>; 1552; 53 unnumbered
leaves. It gives the eighth of the proposed remedies, assigning twenty reasons against
the enslaving of the natives.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>4. <i>Aqui se cōtienē vnos auisos y reglas para los confessores</i>, etc; 1552; 16 unnumbered

the offices of the Church to such as held <i>repartimientos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p>5. <i>Aqui se contiene vna disputa ... entre el obispo ... y el doctor Gines de Sepulveda</i>;
1552; 61 unnumbered leaves. This strong enunciation of Las Casas’ convictions
grew out of his controversy with Sepulveda.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> It contains, first, a summary by
Domingo de Soto of the differences between the two disputants; second, the arguments
of Sepulveda; and third, the replies of Las Casas,&mdash;twelve in all.</p>

<p>6. <i>Este es vn tratado ... sobre la materia de los Yndios, que se han hecho en ellas
esclauos</i>; 1552; 36 unnumbered leaves. This contains reasons and judicial authorities
on the question of the restitution of the natives to freedom.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></p>

<p>7. <i>Aqui se cōtienē treynta proposiciones ...</i>; 1552; 10 leaves. These are the
Propositions, mentioned on a preceding page, as Las Casas’ reply to those who objected
to the rigor of his rules for his confessors.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<p>8. <i>Principia quedā ex quibus procedendum</i>, etc; 1552; 10 leaves. This gives the
principles on which he conducts his defence of the rights of the natives.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<p>9. <i>Tratado cōprobatorio del imperio soberano</i>, etc.; 80 unnumbered leaves. The
title-date is 1552, but that in the colophon is 1553. The purpose is “to prove the sovereign
empire and universal dominion by which the kings of Castile and Leon hold the West
Indies.”<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>Complete sets of these tracts have become very rare, though it is not uncommon to

<p>In 1571, five years after Las Casas’ death, what is sometimes called a tenth part was
printed at Frankfort, under the title of <i>Explicatio questionis utrum Reges vel Principes
jure aliquo.... Cives ac subditos a regia corona alienare?</i> This further showing of the
arguments of Las Casas is even rarer than its predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> Its authorship, without

as is also a letter of Las Casas which he wrote in 1555 to the Archbishop of Toledo,
protesting against the contemplated sale of <i>Encomiendas</i> in perpetuity, which, being communicated
to the King, led to the prohibition of the plan.</p>

<p>In 1854 Henry Stevens printed, in a style corresponding to that of the tracts of 1552,
a series of six papers from original manuscripts in his possession, interesting as contributions
to the history of Las Casas and his work;<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> and there is also a letter of Las Casas
in the volume a few years since printed by the Spanish Government as <i>Cartas de Indias</i>.
There is an enumeration of thirteen other treatises, noted as still in manuscript, which is to
be found in Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i> or in his separate <i>Works of Las Casas</i>; but Mr. Field is
inclined for one reason or another to reduce the number to five, in addition to the two
which were published by Llorente.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> There are also two manuscripts recorded in the

          <p class="pf400">[This is slightly reduced from the fac-simile
given in vol. iii. of the 1875 (Madrid)
edition of the <i>Historia</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>The most labored of Las Casas’ books was his <i>Historia de las Indias</i>,&mdash;the original
manuscript of which is still preserved, according to Helps, in the library of the Academy
of History at Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> Las Casas began this work while in his convent in 1527,<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> and
seems to have worked upon it, without finishing it, up to 1561. It has all the fervor
and vigor of his nature; and so far as it is the result of his own observation, its character
is unimpeachable. It is in large part, as Helps has remarked, autobiographic; but it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
not bring the story down later than 1520. Its style is characteristically rambling and
awkward, and more or less confused with extraneous learning, the result of his convent
studies, and interjected with his usual bursts of a somewhat tiresome indignation. Outside
of his own knowledge he had large resources in documents, of which we have no
present knowledge. He seems to have had a prescience of the feelings in his countrymen
which would long keep the manuscript from the printing-office, for he left instructions at
his death that no one should use it for forty years. The injunction did not prevent
Herrera having access to it; and when this latter historian published his book in 1601, the
world got a large part of Las Casas’ work,&mdash;much of it copied by Herrera <i>verbatim</i>,&mdash;but
extracted in such a way that Las Casas could have none of his proper effect in ameliorating
the condition of the Indians and exposing the cruelty of their oppression. In this way
Las Casas remained too long eclipsed, as Irving says, by his copyist. Notwithstanding
the publication of the book was prohibited, various manuscript copies got abroad, and
every reputable historian of the Spanish rule has made use of Las Casas’ labors.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> Finally,
the Royal Academy of History at Madrid undertook the revision of the manuscript; but
that body was deterred from putting their revision on the press by the sentiments, which
Spanish scholars had always felt, adverse to making public so intense an arraignment of
their countrymen.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> At last, however, in 1875-1876, the Academy finally printed it in five
volumes.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> The <i>Historia</i> was of course not included, nor were two of the tracts of the
issues of 1552 (nos. 4 and 8) embraced, in the edition of Las Casas’ <i>Obras</i> which Llorente
issued in Paris in 1822 in the original Spanish, and also in the same year in a French
translation, <i>Œuvres de Las Casas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> This work is dedicated “Au modèle des virtues
héréditaires, A. M. le Comte de las Casas.” Sufficient recognition has been made in the
preceding narrative of this work of Llorente. As a Spaniard by birth, and a scholar
well read in the historical literature of his own country, as one trained and exercised in
the priestly office, though he had become more or less of a heretic, and as a most ardent
admirer of the virtues and the heroic services of the great Apostle to the Indians, he had
the attainments, qualifications, and motives for discharging with ability and fidelity the
biographical and editorial task which he undertook. It is evident from his pages that he
devoted conscientious labor in investigation, and a purpose of strict impartiality to its
discharge. He is not an undiscriminating eulogist of Las Casas, but he penetrates with
a true sympathetic admiration to the noble unselfishness and the sublime constancy
of this sole champion of righteousness against powerful forces of iniquity.</p>

<p>The number of versions of all or of part of the series of the 1552 tracts into other
languages strikingly indicates the interest which they created and the effect which they
produced throughout Europe. None of the nations showed more eagerness to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
public these accusations against the Spaniards by one of their own number, than the
Flemings and Dutch. The earliest of all the translations, and one of the rarest of these
publications, is the version of the first tract, with parts of others, which appeared in the
dialect of Brabant, in 1578,&mdash;the precursor of a long series of such testimonies, used to
incite the Netherlanders against the Spanish rule.<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> The French came next with their
<i>Tyrannies et cruautéz des Espagnols</i>, published at Antwerp in 1579, in which the translator,
Jacques de Miggrode, softened the horrors of the story with a due regard for his
Spanish neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> A somewhat bolder venture was a new version, not from the originals,
but from the Dutch translation, and set out with all the horrors of De Bry’s seventeen
engravings, which was supplied to the French market with an Amsterdam imprint in 1620.
It is a distorted patchwork of parts of the three of the 1552 tracts. In a brief preface,
the translator says that the part relating to the Indies is derived from the original, printed
at Seville by Sebastian Trugillo in 1552, the writer “being Las Casas, who seems to be
a holy man and a Catholic.” There were still other French versions, printed both in France
and in Holland. The earliest English translation is a version signed by M. M. S.,
entitled <i>The Spanish Colonie, or Briefe Chronicle of the Acts and Gestes of the Spaniardes
in the West Indies, called the Newe Worlde, for the Space of XL. Yeeres</i>, issued in London
in 1583.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> The best-known of the English versions is <i>The Tears of the Indians</i>, “made English
by J. P.,” and printed in London in 1656.<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> “J. P.” is John Phillips, a nephew of John
Milton. His little book, which contains a terse translation of Las Casas’s “Cruelty,” etc.,
without his controversy with Sepulveda, is dedicated to Oliver Cromwell. It is prefaced
by a glowing appeal “To all true Englishmen,” which rehearses the proud position they
hold in history for religion, liberty, and human rights, and denounces the Spaniards as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
“a Proud, Deceitful, Cruel, and Treacherous Nation, whose chiefest Aim hath been the
Conquest of this Land,” etc., closing with a call upon them to aid the Protector in the
threatened contest for the West Indies.</p>

<p>While Phillips places the number of the slaughtered Indians at twenty millions, these
are reckoned at forty millions by the editor of another English version, based upon the
French <i>Tyrannies et cruautéz</i>, which was printed at London, in 1699, as <i>A Relation of
the First Voyages and Discoveries made by the Spaniards in America</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> The earliest German
edition appeared, in 1597, as <i>Newe Welt: warhafftige Anzeigung der Hispanier
grewlichen ... Tyranney</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> The Latin edition appeared at Frankfort, in 1598, as
<i>Narratio regionum Indicarvm per Hispanos qvosdam deuastatarum verissima</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> This
Latin translation has a brief introduction, mainly a quotation from Lipsius, commenting on
these atrocities. The version is spirited and faithful, covering the narrative of Las Casas
and his discussion with Sepulveda. The engravings by De Bry are ghastly and revolting,
and present all too faithfully the shocking enormities related in the text. It is a fearful
parody of deception and truth which introduces a hooded friar as holding a crucifix before
the eyes of one under torment by fire or mutilation. We can scarcely regret that the circumstances
under which the indiscriminate slaughter was waged but rarely allowed of this
desecration of a sacred symbol. The artist has overdrawn his subjects in delineating
heaps of richly wrought and chased vessels as brought by the hounded victims to appease
their tormentors.</p>

<p>To close this list of translations, it is only necessary to refer to the sundry ways in
which Las Casas was helped to create an influence in Italy, the Italian text in these
publications usually accompanying the Spanish.<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>

<h3><a name="c343" id="c343">EDITORIAL NOTE.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE most important distinctive lives of Las
Casas are those of Llorente, prefixed to
his edition of Las Casas’ <i>Œuvres</i>; that which
Quintana (born, 1772; died, 1857) gives in his
<i>Vidas de Españoles célebres</i>, vol. iii., published at
Madrid in 1833, and reprinted, with Quintana’s
<i>Obras</i>, in the <i>Biblioteca de autores Españoles</i> in
1852; and the <i>Vida y escritos de Las Casas</i> of A.
M. Fabié, published at Madrid in 1879, in two
volumes, with a large number of unpublished
documents, making vols. 70 and 71 of the
<i>Documentos inéditos</i> (<i>España</i>). The life which was
constructed mainly by the son of Arthur Helps
out of <i>The Spanish Conquest in America</i> by the
father, is the most considerable account in English.
The larger work was written in a spirit
readily appreciative of the character of Las Casas,
and he is made such a centre of interest in it as
easily to favor the excision of parts of it to form
the lesser book. This was hardly possible with
the broader connections established between
Las Casas and his times which accompany the
portrayal of his career in the works of Prescott
and H. H. Bancroft. The great
friend of the Indian is mainly, however,
to be drawn from his own writings.</p>

<p>Las Casas was by no means alone
in his advocacy of the rights of the
natives, as Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Am. Vet.
Add.</i>, p. 119) has pointed out; naming
Julian Garces, Francis of Vittoria,
Diego de Avendaño, Alonzo de Noreña,
and even Queen Isabel herself,
as evinced by her will (in Dormer,
<i>Discursos varios</i>, p. 381). The fame
of Las Casas was steadfastly upheld
by Remesal in his <i>Historia de Chyapa</i>,
etc., 1619 (cf. Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, ii. 339);
and the great apostle found a successor in his
labors in Juan de Palafox y Mendoça, whose
appeal to the King, printed about 1650, and
called <i>Virtudes del Indio, é naturaleza y costumbres
de los Indios de Nueva España</i>, has become
very rare. (Cf. Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 691.)
Brasseur de Bourbourg, in the fourth volume of
his <i>Nations civilisées du Mexique</i>, set forth in all
their enormity the barbarities of the Spanish
conquerors; but he seeks to avoid all imputations
of exaggeration by shunning the evidence
drawn from Las Casas.</p>

<p>The opponents of Las Casas&mdash;who became
in due time the best-hated man in the Spanish
colonies&mdash;were neither few nor powerless, as
the thwarting of Las Casas’ plans constantly
showed. The Fray Toribio Motolinia took issue
with Las Casas, and Ramirez, in his Life of
Motolinia contained in Icazbalceta’s <i>Coleccion</i>,
undertakes to show (p. lvii) the difference between
them. Cf. B. Smith’s <i>Coleccion</i>, p. 67.</p>

</div>

<p>The most conspicuous of his fellow-observers,
who reached conclusions constantly quite at variance
with Las Casas, was Gonzalo Fernandez
de Oviedo y Valdes,&mdash;to give his full name,
though Oviedo is the one by which he is usually
cited. Oviedo was but a few years younger than
Las Casas. He had seen Columbus’ triumph at
Barcelona, and had come to America with Pedrarias
ten years after Las Casas, and spent thirty-four
of the next forty years in the New World,
holding part of the time the office of inspector of
the gold-smeltings at Darien, and latterly living at
Hispaniola. He is thought to have begun his
historical studies as early as 1520, and he published
his first book, usually called the <i>Sumario</i>,
in 1526, on his return from his second voyage.
It is a description of the West Indies and its
natives. Returning to Spain in 1530, he was
after a while made the official chronicler of the
Indies, and in 1535 began the publication of his
great <i>Historia de las Indias</i>. On this chief
labor Ticknor (<i>Spanish Literature</i>, ii. 33)
traces him at work certainly as late as 1548, and he
may have added to it down to 1555. He had the
royal direction to demand of the various governors
whatever document and aid he might need
as he went on. Ticknor calls him the first authorized
chronicler of the New World,&mdash;“an office,”
he adds, “which was at one time better paid than
any other similar office in the kingdom, and was
held at different times by Herrera, Tamayo, Solis,
and other writers of distinction, and ceased
(he believed) with the creation of the Academy
of History.” Oviedo was a correspondent of
Ramusio, and found the acquaintance helpful.
He knew Cortes, and exchanged letters with
him. Ticknor, after speaking of the scope of
the <i>Historia</i> as taxing the powers of Oviedo
beyond their strength, still accounts the work of
great value as a vast repository of facts, and not
wholly without merit as a composition.</p>

<p>In the estimates commonly made of Oviedo there is allowed
him but scant scholarship, little power of
discrimination,&mdash;as shown in his giving at times
as much weight to hearsay evidence as to established
testimony,&mdash;a curious and shrewd insight,
which sometimes, with his industry, leads him
to a better balance of authorities than might be
expected from his deficient judgment. His resources
of material were uncommon; but his
use of them is generally tedious, with a tendency
to wander from his theme.
Ternaux sees in him the prejudices
of his times,&mdash;and
these were not certainly very
friendly to the natives. Las
Casas could no more endure
him than he could bear with
the average <i>conquistador</i>. The
bishop charges the historian
with constantly bearing false
witness against the Indians,
and with lying on every page.
Oviedo died at Valladolid in
1557. (Cf. Prescott’s <i>Mexico</i>,
ii. 283; Irving’s <i>Columbus</i>,
App. xxviii.; H. H. Bancroft,
<i>Chroniclers</i>, p. 20, and <i>Central
America</i>, i. 309, 463-467.)</p>

<p>The bibliography of Oviedo
deserves to be traced. His
initial publication, <i>De la natural
hystoria de las Indias</i>,
was printed at Toledo in 1526,&mdash;not
in 1525, as the Real
Academia says in their reprint,
nor 1528, as Ticknor
gives it. It is often cited as
Oviedo’s <i>Sumario</i>, since that
is the first word of the secondary
title. (Cf. Sabin, <i>Dictionary</i>,
vol. xiv. no. 57,987;
Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>,
p. 12; and <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>,
no. 139; Ternaux, no. 35; Rich,
1832, no. 6, £12 12<i>s.</i>; Carter-Brown,
i. 89.) There are
also copies in the Library of Congress and Harvard
College. The Spanish text is included in
Barcia’s <i>Historiadores primitivos</i> and in Vedia’s
<i>Hist. prim. de Indias</i>, 1858, vol. i. It is in large
part translated into English in Eden’s <i>Decades
of the New World</i>, 1555 (chap. 18), and this version
is condensed in Purchas’s <i>Pilgrimes</i>, iv. 5.
There is an Italian version in Ramusio’s <i>Viaggi</i>,
iii. 44.</p>

<p>The publication of Oviedo’s great work, which
is quite different from the 1526 book, was begun
at Seville, in 1535, under the title of <i>Historia
general de las Indias</i>. In this he gave the first
nineteen books, and ten chapters of book 20. At
the end is a <i>carta missiva</i>, to which the author
usually attached his own signature, and that
annexed is taken (slightly reduced) from the
copy in Harvard College Library. (Cf. Sabin,
vol. xiv. no. 57,988; Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Am. Vet.</i>, no.
207; Murphy, nos. 1886-87; Carter-Brown, i.
114, with fac-simile of title.) Ramusio translated
these nineteen books. In 1547, what purports to
be a summary, but is in fact a version, of Xeres
by Jacques Gohory, appeared in Paris as <i>L’histoire
de la terre neuve du Péru en l’Inde occidentale</i>.
(Cf. <i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, no. 264; Ternaux, no. 52;
Sabin, vol. xiv. no. 57,994.)</p>

<p>In 1547 a new edition of the Spanish, somewhat
increased, appeared at Salamanca as
<i>Coronica de las Indias; la hystoria general de
las Indias agora nueuamente impressa, corregida, y
emendada</i>. Sometimes it is found in the same
cover with the <i>Peru</i> of Xeres, and then the title
varies a little. The book is rare and costly.
Rich, in 1832 (no. 17), priced it at £10 10<i>s.</i>; it
has been sold recently at the Sunderland sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
for £61, and in the library of an old admiral
(1883, no. 340) for £40; Quaritch has priced it
at £63, and Maisonneuve (Leclerc, no. 432), at
1,000 francs. There is a copy in Harvard College
Library. (Cf. Sabin, vol. xiv. no. 57,989;
Carter-Brown, i. 145; <span class="smcap">Bibl. Am. Vet.</span>, no. 278;

<p>A full French translation of ten books, made
by Jean Poleur, appeared in Paris under the
title of <i>Histoire naturelle
et généralle des Indes</i>, without
the translator’s name
in 1555, and with it in 1556. (Cf.
Sabin, vol. xiv. no. 57,992-93; Ternaux,
no. 47; Carter-Brown, i. 214;
Beckford, iii. 342; Murphy, no. 1884; Leclerc,
no. 434, 130 francs, and no. 2,888, 350 francs;
Quaritch, no. 12,313, £7 10<i>s.</i>) There is a copy
in Harvard College Library.</p>

<p>The twentieth book, <i>Libro xx de la segunda
parte de la general historia de las Indias</i> appeared
for the first time and separately at Valladolid in
1557; the death of the author while his book
was in press prevented the continuance of its
publication. (Cf. Rich, 1832, no. 34, £6 6<i>s.</i>;
Sabin, vol. xiv. no. 57,991; Carter-Brown, i. 219.)</p>

<p>The fate of the remaining parts of the manuscript
was for a while uncertain. Rich, in 1832,
said that books xxi. to xxviii., which were in the
printer’s hands at Oviedo’s death, were not recovered,
while he knew of manuscript copies
of books xxix. to xlviii. in several collections.
Irving says he found a copy of the unprinted
parts in the Colombina Library at Seville.
Harrisse <i>(Notes on Columbus</i> and <i>Bibl. Am. Vet.</i>,
no. 207) says the manuscript was scattered, but
was brought together again after some vicissitudes.
Another statement places it in the Casa
de la Contratacion after Oviedo’s death; whence
it was transferred to the Convent of Monserrat.
Meanwhile sundry manuscript copies were taken.
(Cf. <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 17.) In 1775 the
publication of it was ordered by Government;
but it was not till 1851-1855 that the Real
Academia de la Historia at Madrid issued the
fifty books, complete in four volumes folio,
under the editing of José Amador de los Rios,
who added to the publication several maps, a
bibliography, and the best Life of Oviedo yet
written. (Cf. Sabin, vol. xiv. no. 57,990; the
set is worth about $20. See further, Brunet, iv.
299; Ternaux, no. 46; Panzer, vii. 124; Stevens,
<i>Nuggets</i>, ii. 2,067.) Ternaux had already, in
1840, published in French, as a <i>Histoire de
Nicaragua</i> (in his second series, vol. iii.) thirteen
chapters of book xlii.</p>

<p>There was an Italian traveller in the Spanish
provinces between 1541 and 1556 who, while he
thought that Las Casas mistook his vocation in
attempting to administer a colony, bears evidence
to the atrocities which Las Casas so persistently
magnified. This wanderer was a Milanese, Girolamo
Benzoni, who at the early age of twenty-two
had started on his American travels. He
did not altogether succeed in ingratiating himself
with the Spaniards whom he encountered,
and perhaps his discontent colored somewhat
his views. He was not much of a scholar,
yielded not a little to credulity, and picked up
mere gossip indeed, but of a kind which gives us
much light as to the conditions both of the Europeans
and natives. (Cf. Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
no. 117; Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, ii. 232;
Admiral Smith’s Introduction to the Hakluyt
Society edition.) After his return he prepared
and published&mdash;prefixing his own likeness, as
shown here in fac-simile&mdash;the results of his observations
in his <i>Historia del Mondo Nuovo</i>,
which was issued at Venice in 1565. It became
a popular book, and spread through Europe
not only in the original Italian, but in
French and Latin versions. In Spanish it
never became current; for though it so greatly
concerns that people, no one of them ventured
to give it the help of a translation into their
vernacular; and as be had not said much in
praise of their American career, it is not altogether
strange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>The bibliography of the book merits explanation.
It is treated at length in Sabin’s
<i>Dictionary</i>, vol. ii. no. 4,791, and in the <i>Studi
biog. e bibliog. della Società Geografica Italiana</i>,
i. 293 (1882). The original Italian edition, <i>La
Historia del Mondo Nuovo, laqual tratta dell’
Isole &amp; Mari nuovamente ritrovati, &amp; delle
nuove Citta da lui proprio vedute, per acqua &amp;
per terra in quattordeci anni</i>, was published at
Venice in 1565. There are copies in Harvard
College, Cornell University, and the Carter-Brown
libraries. Cf. Rich (1832), no. 43&mdash;£1
1<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; Leclerc (1878), no. 59&mdash;120 francs; A. R.
Smith (1874), £2 2<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; Brinley, no. 10;
Carter-Brown, i. 253; Huth, i. 132; Field,
<i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 117; Sparks,
no. 240; Stevens (1870), no. 171. A second
Italian edition&mdash;<i>Nuovamente ristampata...
con la giunta d’alcune cose notabile dell’Isole
di Canaria</i>&mdash;was issued at Venice in
1572. Cf. Rich (1832), no. 49, £1 1<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>;
Carter-Brown, i. 289; Stevens, no. 172;

<p>The first Latin edition <i>Novæ Novi Orbis
Historiæ</i>, translated by Urban Chauveton
(who added an account of the French expedition
to Florida), was published at
Geneva in 1578; followed by a second in
1581; a third in 1586, with Lery’s book
on Brazil added; others in 1590 (no place);
1598 and 1600 (Geneva); (Coloniæ Allobrogum),
1612, with three other tracts;
and at Hamburg in 1648. Besides these
the Latin version appeared in De Bry,
parts iv., v., and vi., printed at Frankfort
in 1592, 1593, 1594, 1595, and at Oppenheim
in 1617. Cf. Carter-Brown, i. 318, 338,
365; ii. 123, 629; Stevens, <i>Nuggets</i>, 2,300;
<i>Bibl. Hist.</i>, no. 173-174; Muller (1872), nos. 78,
79; (1877), 287; Sunderland, no. 1,214; Cooke,
nos. 218, 222; Pinart, no. 97; Huth, i. 132; Field,
p. 119. There are copies of the 1578 edition in
the Boston Public and Harvard College libraries.</p>

<p>The French editions were issued at Geneva
in 1579 and 1589. The notes are different from
those of the Latin editions; and there are no
notes to book iii., as in the Latin. Cf. Carter-Brown,
i. 326; Cooke, no. 221; Court, no. 32.</p>

<p>There are two German versions. The first
was by Nicholas Höniger, and was printed at
Basle, in 1579, as <i>Der Newenn Weldt</i>. It was
reissued, with tracts of Peter Martyr and others,
in 1582. The version of Abel Scherdigers was
issued at Helmstadt in 1590, 1591, again at
Frankfort in 1595, and at Wittenberg in 1606.
There were in addition some later imprints,
besides those included in De Bry and in Saeghman’s
<i>Voyagien</i>. Cf. Rich, no. 61; Carter-Brown,
i. 344, 388, ii. 44, 917; Muller (1872), nos. 80,
1880, (1877), 286.</p>

<p>The first Dutch edition appeared at Haarlem
in 1610; there was an abridged issue at Amsterdam
in 1663. Cf. Tiele, nos. 276, 277; Muller
(1872), nos. 81, 82; Carter-Brown, ii. 97.</p>

<p>Purchas gave an abstract in English; but
there was no complete English version till Admiral
Smith’s was published by the Hakluyt
Society in 1857. This has fac-similes of the cuts
of the 1572 edition; and De Bry also followed
the early cuts.</p>

<p>In 1542 and 1543 Las Casas largely influenced
the royal decrees relating to the treatment of
the Indians, which were signed by the monarch,
Nov. 20, 1542, and June 4, 1543, and printed at
Alcala in 1543 as <i>Leyes y Ordenanças</i>. This
book stands as the earliest printed ordinances
for the New World, and is rare. Rich in 1832 (no.
13) priced it at £21. (Cf. <i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, no. 247;
Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 130; Sabin, vol. x. p. 320.)
There were later editions at Madrid in 1585,<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a>
and at Valladolid in 1603. Henry Stevens, in
1878, issued a fac-simile edition made by Harris
after a vellum copy in the Grenville Collection,
accompanied by a translation, with an historical
and bibliographical introduction.</p>

<p>The earliest compilation of general laws for
the Indies, entitled <i>Provisiones, cedulas, instrucciones
de su Magestad</i>, was printed in Mexico in
1563. This is also very rare; Rich priced it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
1832 at £16 16<i>s.</i> It was the work of Vasco de
Puga, and Helps calls it “the earliest summary
of Spanish colonial law.” The Carter-Brown
copy (<i>Catalogue</i>, i. 242) was sent to England for
Mr. Helps’s use, there being no copy in that
country, so far as known.</p>

<p>The next collection was <i>Provisiones, cédulas</i>,
etc., arranged by Diego de Encinas, and was
printed at Madrid in 1596. The work early became
scarce, and Rich priced it at £5 5<i>s.</i> in 1832
(no. 81). It is in Harvard College and the Carter-Brown
Library (<i>Catalogue</i>, vol. i. no. 502). The
bibliography of the general laws, particularly of
later collections, is sketched in Bancroft’s <i>Central
America</i>, i. 285, and <i>Mexico</i>, iii. 550; and in
chap. xxvii. of this same volume the reader will
find an examination of the administration and
judicial system of the Spaniards in the New
World;<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> and he must go chiefly to Bancroft
(<i>Central America</i>, i. 255, 257, 261, 285; <i>Mexico</i>,
ii. 130, 516, 563, etc.) and Helps (<i>Spanish Conquest
and Life of Las Casas</i>) for aid in tracing
the sources of the subject of the legal protection
sought to be afforded to the natives, and the
attempted regulation of the slavery which they
endured. Helps carefully defines the meaning
and working of the <i>encomienda</i> system, which
gave in effect a property value to the subjection
of the natives to the Conquerors. Cf. <i>Spanish
Conquest</i> (Am. ed.), iii. 113, 128, 157, 212.</p>

<p class="pc1 large">CORTÉS AND HIS COMPANIONS.</p>

<p class="pc2">BY JUSTIN WINSOR,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>The Editor.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap08">GRIJALVA had returned in 1518 to Cuba from his Western expedition,<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>
flushed with pride and expectant of reward. It was his fate, however,
to be pushed aside unceremoniously, while another was sent to follow
up his discoveries. Before Grijalva had returned, the plan was formed;
and Hernando Cortés distanced his competitors in suing for the leadership
of the new expedition. Cortés was at this time the <i>alcalde</i> of Santiago in
Cuba, and about thirty-three years old,&mdash;a man agile in mind, and of a
frame well compacted for endurance; with a temper to please, and also to
be pleased, if you would but wait on his wishes. He had some money,
which Velasquez de Cuellar, the Governor, needed; he knew how to decoy
the intimates of the Governor, and bait them with promises: and so the
appointment of Cortés came, but not altogether willingly, from Velasquez.</p>

<p>Cortés was born in Spain,<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> of humble, respectable stock. Too considerable
animal spirits had made him an unprofitable student at Salamanca,
though he brought away a little Latin and a lean store of other learning.
A passion for the fairer sex and some military ardor, dampened with scant
income all the while, characterized the following years; till finally, in 1504,
he sailed on one of the fleets for the New World. Here he soon showed
his quality by participating in the suppression of an Indian revolt. This
got him a small official station, and he varied the monotony of life with
love intrigues and touches of military bravado. In 1511, when Diego
Columbus sent Velasquez on an expedition to Cuba, Cortés joined it as
the commander’s executive officer. A certain adroitness turned a quarrel
which he had with Velasquez (out of which grew his marriage with
a fair Catalina) to his advantage with the Governor, who made him in the
end the <i>alcalde</i> of Santiago,&mdash;a dignity which mining and stock-raising
luckily enabled the adventurer to support. He was in this condition when
all schemes worked happily, and Velasquez was induced to commission
him commander-in-chief of the new expedition.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Governor gave him
instructions on the 23d of October, 1518. Cortés understood, it turned
out, that these were to be followed when necessary and disregarded when
desirable. There seemed, indeed, to have been no purpose to confine the
business of the expedition to exploration, as the instructions set forth.<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>
Cortés put all his substance into ships and outfits. He inveigled his friends
into helping him. Velasquez converted what Government resources he
could to the purpose of the expedition, while at the same time he seems
to have cunningly sold to Cortés his own merchandise at exorbitant prices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Twenty thousand ducats apparently went into somebody’s pockets to get
the expedition well started.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> Three hundred men, including some of
position, joined him. The Governor’s jester, instigated, as is supposed,
by Velasquez’ relatives, threw out a hint that Cortés was only preparing
to proclaim his independence when he reached the new domain. The
thought worried the Governor, and seems in part to have broken the spell
of the admiration which he entertained for Cortés; yet not so much so but
he could turn a cold shoulder to Grijalva when he arrived with his ships,
as happened at this juncture.</p>

<p>Cortés could not afford to dally; and secret orders having been given
for all to be in readiness on the evening of the 17th of November, on the
next morning the fleet sailed.<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> There were six vessels composing it, and
a seventh later joined them. At Trinidad (Cuba) his force was largely
augmented with recruits from Grijalva’s men. Here messengers arrived
from Velasquez, ordering the authorities to depose Cortés and put another
in command. Cortés had, however, too strongly environed himself; and
he simply took one of the messengers into his service, and sent back the
other with due protestations of respect. Then he sailed to San Cristóbal
(Havana), sending a force overland to pick up horses. The flagship met
a mishap on the way, but arrived at last. Cortés landed and displayed
his pomp. Letters from Velasquez still followed him, but no one dared
to arrest him. He again sailed. His fleet had now increased to twelve
vessels, the largest measuring one hundred tons; his men were over six hundred,
and among them only thirteen bore firelocks; his artillery consisted
of ten guns and four falconets. Two hundred natives, men and women,
were taken as slaves. Sixteen horses were stowed away on or below
deck.<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> This was the force that a few days later, at Guaguanico, Cortés
passed in review, while he regaled his men with a specious harangue,
steeped in a corsair’s piety. On the 18th of February they steered boldly
away on the mission which was to become famous.</p>

<p>Looking around upon his officers, Cortés could discover, later if not
then, that he had some stanch lieutenants. There was Pedro de Alvarado,
who had already shown his somewhat impetuous quality while serving
under Grijalva. There was Francisco de Montejo, a good administrator
as well as a brave soldier. Names not yet forgotten in the story of the
Conquest were those of Alonso de Avila, Cristóbal de Olid, and the
youngest of all, Gonzalo de Sandoval, who was inseparable from his white
stallion Motilla. Then there were Velasquez de Leon, Diego de Ordaz,
and others less known to fame.</p>

<p>The straggling vessels gathered again at Cozumel Island, near the point
of Yucatan. Cortés sent an expedition to discover and ransom some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Christians who were in the interior, as he heard. The mission failed; but
a single one of the wanderers, by some other course, found the Spaniards,
and was welcomed as an interpreter. This man reported that he and
another were the sole survivors of a ship’s company wrecked on the
coast eight years before.</p>

They were breech-loaders by means of chambers,
three of which, with handles, are seen (in

the Mexican war, that are supposed to be the ones
used by Cortés. A search of the records of the
Ordnance Department at Washington, instituted
for me by Commodore Sicard, at the suggestion
of Prof. Charles E. Munroe of the Naval Academy,
has not, however, revealed any documentary
evidence; but a paper in the <i>Army and Navy
Journal</i>, Nov. 22, 1884, p. 325, shows such guns
to have been captured by Lieutenant Wyse in the
“Darien.” The guns at Annapolis are provided
with like chambers, as seen in photographs kindly
sent to me. Similar chambers are now, or were
recently, used in firing salutes on the Queen’s

<p>Early in March the fleet started to skirt the Yucatan shore, and Cortés
had his first fight with the natives at Tabasco,&mdash;a conflict brought on
for no reason but that the town would not supply provisions. The stockade
was forced, and the place formally occupied. A more signal victory
was required; and the Spaniards, getting on shore their horses and
artillery, encountered the savage hordes and dispersed them,&mdash;aided, as
the veracious story goes, by a spectral horseman who shone upon the
field. The native king only secured immunity from further assaults by
large presents. The Spaniards then re-embarked, and next cast anchor
at San Juan de Ulloa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rumors of the descent of the Spaniards on the coast had
certainly hurried to Montezuma at his capital; and his people doubtless
rehearsed some of the many portents which are said to have been regarded.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>

<p>The coming of Cortés was but a dreaded return. While his ship lay
at Juan de Ulloa, two canoes came from the main, and their occupants
climbed to his deck. No one
could understand them. The
rescued Spaniard who had
been counted on as an interpreter
was at a loss. At last
a female slave, Marina by
name, taken at Tabasco,
solved the difficulty. She
could understand this same
Spaniard, and knew also Aztec.<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>
Through this double
interpretation Cortés now
learned that the mission of
his visitors was one of welcome
and inquiry. After the
usual interchange of gifts,
Cortés sent word to the cacique
that he would soon
confer with him. He then
landed a force, established a
camp, and began to barter
with the natives. To a chief,
who soon arrived, Cortés announced
his intention to seek the presence of Montezuma and to deliver
the gifts and messages with which he was charged as the ambassador of
his sovereign. Accordingly, bearing such presents as Cortés cared to
send forward, native messengers were sent to Montezuma to tell tales of
the sights they had seen,&mdash;the prancing horses and the belching cannon.
The Mexican king sought to appease the eagerness of the new-comers by
returning large stores of fabrics and gold, wishing them to be satisfied and
to depart. The gold was not a happy gift to produce such an end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cortés, by his craft, quieted a rising faction of the party
of Velasquez which demanded to be led back to Cuba. He did this by
seeming to acquiesce in the demand of his followers in laying the foundations
of a town and constituting its people a municipality competent to
choose a representative of the royal authority. This done, Cortés resigned
his commission from Velasquez, and was at once invested with supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
power by the new municipality. The scheme which Velasquez had suspected
was thus brought to fruition. Whoever resisted the new captain
was conquered by force, persuasion, tact, or magnetism; and Cortés
became as popular as he was irresistible.</p>

<p>At this point messengers presented themselves from tribes not far off who
were unwilling subjects of the Aztec power. The presence of possible allies
was a propitious circumstance, and Cortés proceeded to cultivate the friendship
of these tribes. He moved his camp day by day along the shore,
inuring his men to marches, while the fleet sailed in company. They
reached a large city, and were regaled. Each chief told of the tyranny of
Montezuma, and the eyes of Cortés glistened. The Spaniards went on to
another town, slaves being provided to bear their burdens. Here they
found tax-gatherers of Montezuma collecting tribute. Emboldened by
Cortés’ glance, his hosts seized the Aztec emissaries and delivered them
to the Spaniards. Cortés now played a double game. He propitiated the
servants of Montezuma by secretly releasing them, and added to his allies
by enjoining every tribe he could reach to resist the Aztec collectors of
tribute.</p>

<p>The wandering municipality, as represented in this piratical army, at last
stopped at a harbor where a town (La Villa Rica de Vera Cruz) sprang up,
and became the base of future operations.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

<p>Montezuma and his advisers, angered by the reports of the revolt of his
subjects, had organized a force to proceed against them, when the tax-gatherers
whom Cortés had released arrived and told the story of Cortés’
gentleness and sympathy. It was enough; the rebellion needed no
such active encounter. The troops were not sent, and messengers were
despatched to Cortés, assuring the Spanish leader that Montezuma forbore
to chastise the entertainers of the white strangers. Cortés now
produced other of the tax-gatherers whom he had been holding, and
they and the new embassy went back to Montezuma more impressed
than before; while the neighboring people wondered at the deference paid
by Montezuma’s lieutenants to the Spaniards. It was no small gain for
Cortés to have instigated the equal wonder of two mutually inimical
factions.</p>

<p>The Spanish leader took occasion to increase his prestige by despatching
expeditions hither and thither. Then he learned of efforts made by
Velasquez to supplant him. To confirm his rule against the Cuban Governor
he needed the royal sanction; and the best way to get that was to
despatch a vessel with messages to the Emperor, and give him earnest
of what he might yet expect in piles of gold thrown at his feet. So the
flagship sailed for Spain; and in her in command and to conduct his suit
before the throne, Cortés sent faithful servitors, such as had influence at
court, to outwit the emissaries of Velasquez. Sailing in July, touching at
Cuba long enough to raise the anger of Velasquez, but not long enough for
him to catch them, these followers of Cortés reached Spain in October, and
found the agents of Velasquez ready for them. Their vessel was seized,
and the royal ear was held by Bishop Fonseca and other friends of the
Cuban Governor; yet not so effectually but that the duplicate letters of
Cortés’ messengers were put into the Emperor’s hand, and the train of
natives paraded before him.</p>

<p>Now came the famous resolve of Cortés. He would band his heterogeneous
folk together&mdash;adherents of Cortés and of Velasquez&mdash;in one
common cause and danger. So he adroitly led them to be partners in
the deed which he stealthily planned.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> Hulk after hulk of the apparently
worm-eaten vessels of the fleet sank in the harbor, until there was no
flotilla left upon which any could desert him. The march to Mexico was
now assured. The force with which to accomplish this consisted of about
four hundred and fifty Spaniards, six or seven light guns, fifteen horses, and
a swarm of Indian slaves and attendants. A body of the Totonacs accompanied
them.<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> Two or three days brought them into the higher plain and
its enlivening vegetation. When they reached the dependencies of Montezuma,
they found orders had been given to extend to them every courtesy.
They soon reached the Anahuac plateau, which reminded them not a little
of Spain itself. They passed from cacique to cacique, some of whom
groaned under the yoke of the Aztec; but not one dared do more than
orders from Montezuma dictated. Then the invaders approached the
territory of an independent people, those of Tlascala, who had walled their
country against neighboring enemies. A fight took place at the frontiers,
in which the Spaniards lost two horses. They forced passes against great
odds, but again lost a horse or two,&mdash;which was a perceptible diminution
of their power to terrify. The accounts speak of immense hordes of the
Tlascalans, which historians now take with allowances, great or small.
Cortés spread what alarm he could by burning villages and capturing the
country people. His greatest obstacle soon appeared in the compacted
army of Tlascalans arrayed in his front. The conflict which ensued was
for a while doubtful. Every horse was hurt, and sixty Spaniards were
wounded; but the result was the retreat of the Tlascalans. Divining that
the Spanish power was derived from the sun, the enemy planned a night
attack; but Cortés suspected it, and assaulted them in their own ambush.</p>

<p>Cortés now had an opportunity to display his double-facedness and his
wiles. He received embassies both from Montezuma and from the senate
of the Tlascalans. He cajoled each, and played off his friendship for the
one in cementing an alliance with the other. But to Tlascala and Mexico
he would go, so he told them.</p>

<p>The Tlascalans were not averse, for they
thought it boded no good to the Aztecs if he could be bound to themselves.
Montezuma dreaded the contact, and tried to intimidate the
strangers by tales of the horrible difficulties of the journey.</p>

is a fac-simile from Montanus and
Ogilby, p. 253. The source of the likeness is
not apparent, and the picture seems questionable.
Prescott, in his second volume, gives a
likeness, which belonged to the descendants of
the Aztec king, the Counts of Miravalle. It is
claimed to have been painted by an artist, Maldonado,
who accompanied Cortés; but, on the
other hand, some have represented it as an ideal
portrait painted after the Conquest. Prescott
(vol. ii. p. 72) makes up his description of Montezuma
from various early authorities,&mdash;Diaz,
Zuazo (MS.), Ixtlilxochitl, Gomara, Oviedo,
Acosta, Sahagun, Toribio, etc., particularizing
the references. H. H. Bancroft (<i>Mexico</i>, i. 285)
also depicts him from the early sources. He is
made of an age from forty to fifty-four by different
writers; but the younger period is thought by
most to be nearest. Bancroft refers to the prints
in Th. Armin’s <i>Das alte Mexico</i> (Leipsic, 1865) as
representing a coarse Aztec warrior, and the native
picture in Carbajal Espinosa’s <i>Historia de
México</i> (Mexico, 1862) as purely conventional.
The same writer thinks the colored portrait,
“peint par ordre de Cortes,” in Linati’s <i>Costûmes
et mœurs de Mexique</i> (Brussels) conforms to the
descriptions; while that in Clavigero’s <i>Storia
antica del Messico</i> (1780) is too small to be satisfactory.
The line of Montezuma’s descendants is
traced in Prescott, <i>Mexico</i>, ii. 339, iii. 446, and in
Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, i. 459. Cf. also the portrait
of Montezuma, “d’après Sandoval,” given in
Charton’s <i>Voyageurs</i>, iii. 393, and that in Cumplido’s
Mexican edition of Prescott’s <i>Mexico</i>

<p>Presently the army took up its march for Tlascala, where they were
royally received, and wives in abundance were bestowed upon the leaders.
Next they passed to Cholula, which was subject to the Aztecs; and here
the Spaniards were received with as much welcome as could be expected
to be bestowed on strangers with the hostile Tlascalans in their train.
The scant welcome covered treachery, and Cortés met it boldly. Murder
and plunder impressed the Cholulans with his power, and gave some sweet
revenge to his allies. Through the wiles of Cortés a seeming reconciliation
at last was effected between these neighboring enemies. But the massacre
of Cholula was not a pastime, the treachery of Montezuma not forgotten;
and the march was again resumed, about six thousand native allies of one
tribe and another following the army. The passage of a defile brought
the broad Valley of Mexico into view; and Montezuma, awed by the coming
host, sent a courtier to personate him and to prevail upon Cortés to
avoid the city. The trick and the plea were futile. On to one of the
aquatic cities of the Mexican lakes the Spaniards went, and were received
in great state by a vassal lord of Montezuma, who now invited the Spanish
leader to the Aztec city. On they went. Town after town received them;
and finally, just without his city, Montezuma, in all his finery and pomp, met
the Spanish visitors, bade them welcome, and committed them to an escort
which he had provided. It was the 8th of November, 1519. Later in his
own palace, in the quarters which had been assigned to Cortés, and on
several occasions, the two indulged in reciprocal courtesies and watched
each other. Cortés was not without fear, and his allies warned him of
Aztec treachery. His way to check foul designs was the bold one of seizing
Montezuma and holding him as a hostage; and he did so under pretence
of honoring him. A chieftain who had attacked a party of the Spaniards
by orders of Montezuma some time before, was executed in front of the
palace. Montezuma himself was subjected for a while to chains. Expeditions
were sent out with impunity to search for gold mines; others explored
the coast for harbors. A new governor was sent back to Villa Rica, and he
sent up shipwrights; so it was not long before Cortés commanded a flotilla
on the city lakes, and the captive king was regaled with aquatic sports.</p>

          <p class="pf400">This is reduced from the cut in Henry Stevens’s
<i>American Bibliographer</i>, p. 86, which in
turn is reproduced from the edition of Cortés’
letters published at Nuremberg in 1524. Bancroft
in his <i>Mexico</i> (vol. i. p. 280) gives a greatly
reduced sketch of the same plan, and adds to
it a description and references to the various
sources of our information regarding the Aztec
town; and this may be compared with the same
author’s <i>Native Races</i>, ii. 560. Helps describes
the city in his <i>Spanish Conquest</i> (New York
ed., ii. 277, 423), where he thinks that the early
chroniclers failed to make clear the full number
of the causeways connecting the town with
the main, and traversing the lake. Prescott
describes it in his <i>Mexico</i> (Kirk’s ed., ii. 101),
and discredits the plan given in Bullock’s <i>Mexico</i>
as one prepared by Montezuma for Cortés.
This last plan is also given in Carbajal’s <i>Historia
de México</i> (1862), ii. 221. The nearly equal
distance on all sides at which the shores of the
lake stand from the town is characteristic of
this earliest of the plans (1524); and in this
particular it is followed in various plans and
bird’s-eye views of the town of the sixteenth
century, and in some of a later date. The Aztec
town had been founded in 1325, and had been
more commonly called Tenochtitlan, which the
Spaniards turned into Temixtitan and Tenustitan,
the term Mexico being properly applied
to one of the principal wards of the city.
The two names were first sometimes joined, as
Temixtitlan-Mexico (1555); but in the end the
more pronounceable part survived, and the rest
was lost. Cf. Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, i. 12-14, with references.
The correspondence of sites in the
present city as compared with those of the Aztec
time and of the conquerors, is examined in
Alaman’s <i>Discertaciones sobre la historia de la
república Méjicana</i> (Mexico, 1844-1849), ii. 202,
246; Carbajal Espinosa’s <i>Historia de México</i>,
ii. 226, and by Ramirez in the Mexican edition
of Prescott. Cf. Ant. du Pinet’s <i>Descriptions de
plusieurs villes et forteresses</i>, Lyon, 1564.</p>

<p>Then came symptoms of conspiracy among the native nobles, with the
object of overthrowing the insolent strangers; and Cacama, a nephew
of Montezuma and a chief among them, indulged the hope of seizing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
throne itself. Montezuma protested to his people that his durance was
directed by the gods, and counselled caution. When this did not suffice,
he gave orders, at the instigation of Cortés, to seize Cacama, who was
brought to Mexico and placed in irons. The will of Cortés effected other
displacements of the rural chiefs; and the allegiance of Montezuma to
the Spanish sovereign became very soon as sure and abject as forms could
make it.</p>

<p>Tribute was ordered, and trains bore into the city wealth from all the
provinces,&mdash;to be the cause of heart-burnings and quarrels in the hour
of distribution. The Aztec king and the priests were compelled to order
the removal of idols from their temples, and to see the cross and altar
erected in their places.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the difficulties of Cortés were increasing. The desecration
of the idols had strengthened the party of revolt, and Montezuma was
powerless to quiet them. He warned the Spaniards of their danger.
Cortés, to dispel apprehension, sent men to the coast with the ostensible
purpose of building ships for departure. It was but a trick, however,
to gain time; for he was now expecting a response to his letters sent to
Spain, and he hoped for supplies and a royal commission which might
enable him to draw reinforcements from Cuba.</p>

<p>The renegade leader, however, had little knowledge of what was planning
at this very moment in that island. Velasquez de Cuellar, acting under
a sufficient commission, had organized an expedition to pursue Cortés, and
had given the command of it to Panfilo de Narvaez. The friends of Cortés
and those who dreaded a fratricidal war joined in representations to the
<i>audiencia</i>, which sent Lucas Vasquez de Aillon to prevent an outbreak.
The fleet under Narvaez left Cuba, Aillon on board, with instructions to
reach a peaceable agreement with Cortés; but this failing, they were to
seek other regions. In April, 1520, after some mishaps, the fleet, which
had been the largest ever seen in those waters, anchored at San Juan de
Ulloa, where they got stories of the great success of Cortés from some
deserters of one of his exploring parties. On the other hand, these same
deserters, learning from Narvaez the strength and purpose of the new-comers,&mdash;for
the restraint of Aillon proved ineffectual,&mdash;communicated
with the neighboring caciques; and the news was not slow in travelling to
Montezuma, who heard it not long after the mock submission of Cortés
and the despatching of the ship-builders to the coast.</p>

<p>Narvaez next tried,
in vain, to swerve Velasquez de Leon from his fidelity to Cortés,&mdash;for this
officer was exploring with a party in the neighborhood of the coast. Sandoval,
in command at Villa Rica, learned Narvaez’ purposes from spies;
and when messengers came to demand the surrender of the town, an
altercation ensued, and the chief messengers were seized and sent to
Cortés. The Conqueror received them kindly, and, overcoming their
aversion, he sent them back to Narvaez with letters and gifts calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
to conciliate. While many under Narvaez were affected, the new leader
remained stubborn, seized Aillon, who was endeavoring to mediate, and
sent him on shipboard with orders to sail for Cuba. Thus the arrogance
of Narvaez was greatly helping Cortés in his not very welcome
environment.</p>

<p>Cortés now boldly divided his force; and leaving Alvarado behind with
perhaps one hundred and forty men,&mdash;for the accounts differ,<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>&mdash;and taking
half that number with him, beside native guides and carriers, marched
to confront Narvaez. Velasquez de Leon with his force joined him on
the way, and a little later Sandoval brought further reinforcements; so
that Cortés had now a detachment of nearly three hundred men. Cortés
had prudently furnished them long native lances, with which to meet
Narvaez’ cavalry, for his own horsemen were very few. Adroitness on
the part of Cortés and a show of gold had their effect upon messengers
who, with one demand and another, were sent to him by Narvaez.
Velasquez was sent by Cortés to the enemy’s camp; but the chief gain
to Cortés from this manœuvre was a more intimate knowledge of the army
and purpose of Narvaez. He then resolved to attack the intruder,&mdash;who,
however, became aware of the intention of Cortés, but, under the
stress of a storm, unaccountably relaxed his precautions. Cortés took
advantage of this carelessness;
and attacking boldly
by night, carried everything
before him, and captured
the rival leader. The loss
was but small to either side.
The followers of the invader
now became adherents of
Cortés, and were a powerful
aid in his future movements.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>
The same good
fortune had given him possession
of the invader’s fleet.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile there were
stirring times with Alvarado
in Mexico. The Aztecs
prepared to celebrate a high religious festival. Alvarado learned, or
pretended to learn, that the disaffected native chiefs were planning to
rise upon the Spaniards at its close. So he anticipated their scheme by
attacking them while at their worship and unarmed. Six hundred or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
of the leading men were thus slain. The multitude without the temple
were infuriated, and the Spaniards regained their quarters, not without difficulty,
Alvarado himself being wounded. Behind their defences they managed
to resist attack till succor came.</p>

<p>Cortés, who had learned of the events, was advancing, attaching to himself
the peoples who were inimical to the Aztecs; but as he got within the
Aztec influence he found more sullenness than favor. When he entered
Mexico he was not resisted. The city seemed almost abandoned as his
force made their way to the Spanish fort and entered its gates.</p>

<p>As a means of getting supplies, Cortés ordered the release of a brother
of Montezuma, who at once used his liberty to plan an insurrection. An
attack on the Spanish quarters followed, which Cortés sought to repel by
sorties; but they gained little. The siege was so roughly pressed that
Cortés urged Montezuma to present himself on the parapet and check the
fierceness of the assault. The captive put on his robes of state and addressed
the multitude; but he only became the target of their missiles, and was
struck down by a stone.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> The condition of the Spaniards soon became
perilous in the extreme. A parley with the chief of the Aztecs was of no
avail; and Cortés resolved to cut his way along the shortest causeway from
the city, to the mainland bordering the lake. In this he failed. Meanwhile
a part of his force were endeavoring to secure the summit of a neighboring
pyramid, from which the Mexicans had annoyed the garrison of the fort.
Cortés joined in this attack, and it was successful. The defenders of the
temples on its summit were all killed or hurled from the height, and Cortés
was master of the spot.</p>

<p>Events followed quickly in this June of 1520. There was evidently
a strong will in command of the Mexicans. The brother of Montezuma
was a doughtier foe than the King had been. The temporary success
on the pyramid had not diminished the anxiety of Cortés. Montezuma
was now dying on his hands. The King had not recovered from the
injuries which his own people had inflicted, and sinking spirits completed
the work of the mob. On the 30th of June he died, at the age of forty-one,
having been on the throne since 1503.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Cortés had hoped for some turn
of fortune from this event; but none came. He was more than ever convinced
of the necessity of evacuating the city. Another sortie had failed
as before; and the passage of the causeway was again planned for the
evening of that day.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> The order of march, as arranged, included the whole
Spanish force and about six thousand allies. Pontoons of a rough description
were contrived for bridging the chasms in the causeway. As
many jewels and gold as would not encumber them were taken, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
with such prisoners of distinction as remained to them, besides the sick and
wounded.</p>

         <p class="pf250">This is the map given by Helps in his
<i>Spanish Conquest</i>. One of the differences in
the variety of maps which have been offered
of the Valley of Mexico, to illustrate the conquest
by Cortés, consists in the number and
direction of the causeways. The description
and the remains of the structures themselves
have not sufficed to make investigators of one
mind respecting them. Prescott (Kirk’s ed.,
vol. ii.) does not represent so many causeways
as Helps does. The map in Bancroft (vol. i.
p. 583) is still different in this respect. There
is also a plan of the city and surrounding country
in Cabajal’s <i>México</i> (vol. ii. p. 538); and two
others have been elsewhere given in the present
volume (pp. 364, 379).</p>
</div></div>

<p>A drizzling rain favored their retreat; but the Mexicans were finally
aroused, and attacked their rear. A hundred or more Spaniards were cut
off, and retreated to the fort, where they surrendered a few days later,
and were sacrificed.
The rest,
after losses and
much tribulation,
reached the mainland.
Nothing but
the failure of the
Mexicans to pursue
the Spaniards,
weakened as they
were, saved Cortés
from annihilation.
The Aztecs were
too busy with their
successes; for
forty Spaniards,
not to speak of
numerous allies,
had been taken,
and were to be
immolated; and
rites were to be
performed over
their own dead.</p>

<p>Cortés the next
morning was marshalling the sorry crowd which was left of his army,
when a new attack was threatened. His twelve hundred and fifty Spaniards
and six thousand allies had been reduced respectively to five hundred
and two thousand;<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> and he was glad to make a temple, which was hard
by, a place of refuge and defence. Here he had an opportunity to count
his losses. His cannon and prisoners were all gone. Some of his bravest
officers did not respond to his call. He could count but twenty-four of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
his three or four score of horses. After dark he resumed his march.
His pursuers still worried him, and hunger weakened his men. He lost
several horses at one point, and was himself badly wounded. Reaching
a plain on the 7th of July, the Spaniards confronted a large force
drawn up against
them. Cortés
had but seven
muskets left, and
no powder; so
he trusted to pike
and sabre. With
these he rushed
upon them; but
the swarm of the
enemy was too
great. At last,
however, making
a dash with some
horsemen at the
native commander,
who was recognized
by his
state and banner,
the Mexican was
hurled prostrate
and killed, and
the trophy captured.
The spell
was broken, and the little band of Spaniards and their allies hounded the
craven enemy in every direction. This victory at Otumba (Otompan)
was complete and astounding.</p>

<p>The march was resumed; and not till within the Tlascalan borders was
there any respite and rest. In the capital of his allies Cortés breathed
freer. He learned, however, of misfortunes to detached parties of Spaniards
which had been sent out from Villa Rica. He soon got some small
supplies of ammunition and men from that seaport. Amid all this, Cortés
himself succumbed to a fever from his wounds, and barely escaped death.</p>

<p>Meantime Cuitlahuatzin, the successful brother of Montezuma, had been
crowned in Mexico, where a military rule (improved by what the Spaniards
had taught them) was established. The new monarch sent ambassadors
to try to win the Tlascalans from their fidelity to Cortés; but the scheme
failed, and Cortés got renewed strength in the fast purpose of his allies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
His prompt and defiant ambition again overcame the discontents among
his own men, and induced him to take the field once more against the
Tepeacans, enemies of the Tlascalans, who lived near by. It took about
a month to subdue the whole province. Other strongholds of Aztec
influence fell one by one. The prestige of the Spanish arms was rapidly
re-established, and the Aztec forces went down before them here and there
in detachments. New arrivals on the coast pronounced for Cortés, and
two hundred men and twenty horses soon joined his army. The small-pox,
which the Spaniards had introduced, speedily worked more disaster than
the Spaniards, as it spread through the country; and among the victims
of it was the new monarch of the Aztecs, leaving the throne open to the
succession of Quauhtemotzin, a nephew and son-in-law of Montezuma.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October, 1520, Cortés addressed his second letter to the
Emperor Charles V. He and his adherents craved confirmation for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
acts, and reinforcements. Other letters were despatched to Hispaniola and
Jamaica for recruits and supplies. Some misfortunes prevented the prompt
sailing of the vessel for Spain, and Cortés was enabled to join a supplemental
letter to the Emperor. The vessels also carried away some of the
disaffected, whom Cortés was not sorry to lose, now that others had joined
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cortés had established among the Tepeacans a post of observation
named Segura; and from this centre Sandoval made a successful
incursion among the Aztec dependencies. Cortés himself was again
at Tlascala, settling the succession of its government; for the small-pox
had carried off Maxixcatzin, the firm friend of the Spaniards. Here Cortés
set carpenters to work constructing brigantines, which he intended to
carry to Tezcuco, on the Lake of Mexico, where it was now his purpose
to establish the base of future operations against the Aztec capital. The
opportune arrival of a ship at Villa Rica with supplies and materials of
war was very helpful to him.</p>

<p>Cortés first animated all by a review of his forces, and then went
forward with the advance toward Tezcuco. He encountered little opposition,
and entered the town to find the inhabitants divided in their fears and
sympathies. Many had fled toward Mexico, including the ruler who had
supplanted the one given them by Cortés and Montezuma. Under the
instigation of Cortés a new one was chosen whom he could trust.</p>

<p>Cortés began his approach to Mexico by attacking and capturing, with
great loss to the inhabitants, one of the lake towns; but the enemy, cutting
a dike and flooding the place, forced the retirement of the invaders, who
fell back to Tezcuco. Enough had been accomplished to cause many of
the districts dependent on the Aztecs to send in embassies of submission;
and Cortés found that he was daily gaining ground. Sandoval was sent
back to Tlascala to convoy the now completed brigantines, which were
borne in pieces on the shoulders of eight thousand carriers. Pending the
launching of the fleet, Cortés conducted a reconnoissance round the north
end of the lakes to the scene of his sorrowful night evacuation, hoping for
an interview with an Aztec chief.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">TOPOGRAPHY OF THE MEXICAN VALLEY.</p>
         <p class="pf400">This is the map given in Wilson’s <i>New
Conquest of Mexico</i>, p. 390, in which he makes
the present topography represent that of Cortés’
time, in opposition to the usual view that at the
period of the Conquest the waters of the lake
covered the parts here represented as marsh.
The waters of Tezcuco are at present seven or
eight feet (Prescott says four feet) below the
level of the city, and Wilson contends that they
did not in Cortés’ time much exceed in extent
their present limits; and it is one of his arguments
against Cortés’ representations of deep
water about the causeways that such a level
of the lake would have put the town of Tezcuco
six or seven feet under water. Wilson gives
his views on this point at length in his <i>New
Conquest</i>, pp. 452-460. The map will be seen
also to show the line of General Scott’s approach
to the city in 1847. (Cf. Prof. Henry
Coppée on the “Coincidences of the Conquests
of Mexico, 1520-1847,” in the <i>Journal of the
Military Service Institution</i>, March, 1884.) The
modern city of Mexico lies remote by several
miles from the banks of the lake which represents
to-day the water commonly held to have
surrounded the town in the days of the Conquest.
The question of the shrinking of the
lagunes is examined in Orozco y Berra’s <i>Mémoire
pour la carte hydrographique de la Vallée
de Mexico</i>, and by Jourdanet in his <i>Influence
de la pression de l’air sur la vie de l’homme</i>,
p. 486. A colored map prepared for this latter
book was also introduced by Jourdanet in his
edition of <i>Sahagun</i> (1880), where (p. xxviii) he
again examines the question. From that map
the one here presented was taken, and
the marsh surrounding “Lac de Texcoco”
marks the supposed limits of the lake in Montezuma’s
time. Jourdanet’s map is called,
“Carte hydrographique de la Vallée de Mexico
d’après les travaux de la Commission de la
Vallée en 1862, avec addition des anciennes
limites du Lac de Texcoco.”</p>

<p class="pf400">Humboldt in his <i>Essai politique sur la Nouvelle
Espagne</i>, while studying this problem of
the original bounds of the water, gives a map
defining them as traced in 1804-1807; and this
is reproduced in John Black’s translation of
Humboldt’s <i>Personal Essay on the Kingdom of
New Spain</i>, third edition, London, 1822. Humboldt
gives accounts of earlier attempts to map
the valley with something like accuracy, as was
the case with the Lopez map of 1785. Siguenza’s
map of the sixteenth century, though false, has
successively supplied, through the publication
of it which Alzate made in 1786, the geographical
data of many more modern maps. Cf.
the map in Cumplido’s edition of Prescott’s
<i>Mexico</i> (1846), vol. iii., and the enumeration of
maps of the valley given in Orozco y Berra’s
<i>Cartografia Mexicana</i>, pp. 315-316.</p>

<p class="pf400">A map of Mexico and the lake also appeared
in <i>Le petit atlas maritime</i> (Paris, 1764); and this
is given in fac-simile in the <i>Proceedings of the
American Philosophical Society</i>, xxi. 616, in connection
with a translation of the <i>Codex Ramirez</i>
by Henry Phillips, Jr.</p>

<p class="pf400">There is reason to believe that the decrease
in the waters had begun to be perceptible in
the time of Cortés; and Humboldt traces the
present subsidence to the destruction of neighboring
forests. Bernal Diaz makes record of
the changes observable within his recollection,
and he wrote his account fifty years after the
Conquest.</p>

<p class="pf400">The geographers of the eighteenth century
often made the waters of the valley flow into
the Pacific. The map in the 1704 edition of
Solis shows this; so do the maps of Bower and
other English cartographers, as well as the map
from Herrera on a later page (p. 392).</p>

<p class="pf400">The inundations to which the city has been
subjected (the most serious of which was in
1629), and the works planned for its protection
from such devastations are the subject of
a rare book by Cepeda and Carillo, <i>Relacion
universal del sitio en que esta fundada la ciudad
de México</i> (Mexico, 1637). Copies are found
complete and incomplete. Cf. Carter-Brown,
ii. 441; Leclerc, no. 1,095, complete, 400 francs,
and no. 1,096, incomplete, 200 francs; Quaritch,
incomplete, £10.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In this, however, he failed, and returned
to Tezcuco. Then followed some successful fighting on the line of communication
with the coast, which enabled Cortés to bring up safely some
important munitions, besides two hundred soldiers, who had lately reached
Villa Rica from the islands whither he had sent for help the previous autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spanish leader now conducted another reconnoissance into
the southern borders of the Mexican Valley,&mdash;a movement which overcame
much opposition,&mdash;and selected Coyohuacan as a base of operations
on that side against the Aztec city. After this he returned to Tezcuco, and
was put to the necessity of quelling an insurrection, in which his own death
had been planned.</p>

<p>At last the brigantines were launched. At the command of Cortés the
allies mustered. On the 28th of April, 1521, the Spanish general counted
his own countrymen, and found he had over nine hundred in all, including
eighty-seven horsemen. He had three heavy guns, and fifteen smaller
ones, which were mostly in the fleet. Cortés kept immediate charge of the
brigantines, and allotted the main divisions of the army to Alvarado, Olid,
and Sandoval. The land forces proceeded to occupy the approaches which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the reconnoissances had indicated,&mdash;Alvarado at Tlacopan, Olid at Coyohuacan,
on the westerly shores of the lake, and, later, Sandoval at Iztapalapan,
on the eastern side. Each of these places commanded the entrance
to causeways leading to the city. The land forces were no sooner in position
than Cortés appeared with his fleet. The Aztecs attacked the brigantines
with several hundred canoes; but Cortés easily overcame all, and
established his naval supremacy. He then turned to assist Olid and Alvarado,
who were advancing along their respective causeways; and the stronghold,
Xoloc, at the junction of the causeway, was easily carried. Here the
besiegers maintained themselves with an occasional fight, while Sandoval
was sent to occupy Tepeyacac, which commanded the outer end of the
northern causeway. This completed the investment. A simultaneous
attack was now made from the three camps. The force from Xoloc alone
succeeded in entering the city; but the advantage gained was lost, and
Cortés, who was with this column, drew his forces back to camp. His
success, however, was enough to impress the surrounding people, who were
watching the signs; and various messengers came and offered the submission
of their people to the Spaniards. The attacks were renewed on subsequent
days; and little by little the torch was applied, and the habitable part of
the town grew less and less. The lake towns as they submitted furnished
flotillas, which aided the brigantines much in their incursions into the
canals of the town. For a while the Mexicans maintained night communication
across the lake for supplies; but the brigantines at last stopped
this precarious traffic.</p>

<p>Alvarado on his side had made little progress; but the market of
Tlatelulco was nearer him, and that was a point within the city which it
was desirable to reach and fortify. Sandoval was joined to Alvarado,
who increased the vigor of his assault, while Cortés again attacked on the
other side. The movement failed, and the Mexicans were greatly encouraged.
The Spaniards, from their camps, saw by the blaze of the illuminations
on the temple tops the sacrifice of their companions who had been
captured in the fight. The bonds that kept the native allies in subjection
were becoming, under these reverses, more sensibly loosened day by day,
and Cortés spared several detachments from his weakened force to raid in
various directions to preserve the prestige of the Spanish power.</p>

<p>The attack was now resumed on a different plan. The fighting-men led
the way and kept the Mexicans at bay; while the native auxiliaries razed
every building as they went, leaving no cover for the Aztec marauders.
The demolition extended gradually to the line of Alvarado’s approach,
and communication was opened with him. This leader was now approaching
the great market-place, Tlatelulco. By renewed efforts he gained it,
only to lose it; but the next day he succeeded better, and formed a
junction with Cortés. Not more than an eighth part of the city was now in
the hands of its inhabitants; and here pestilence and famine were the
Spaniards’ prompt allies.</p>

         <p class="pf400">This is the engraving given in the <i>Nieuwe Weereld</i> (1670) of Montanus, which was repeated in Ogilby’s <i>America</i>,
and is familiar from reproductions elsewhere. It may
be traced back as a sketch to the much less
elaborate one given by Bordone in his <i>Libro</i> of
1528, later called his <i>Isolario</i>, which was accompanied
by one of the earliest descriptions by
a writer not a conqueror. Bancroft (<i>Mexico</i>, ii.
14) gives a small outline engraving of a similar
picture, and recapitulates the authorities on the
rebuilding of the city by Cortés. The Cathedral,
however, was not begun till 1573, and was
over sixty years in building (Ibid., iii. 173).</p>

<p class="pf400">One of the most interesting of the early
accounts, accompanied as it was with a plan of
the town and lake, made part of the narrative
of the “Anonymous Conqueror.” This picture
has been reproduced by Icazbalceta in his <i>Coleccion</i>
(i. 390) from the engraving in Ramusio,
whence we derive our only knowledge of this
anonymous writer. The Ramusio plan is also
given on the next page.</p>

<p class="pf400">The plate used in the 1572 edition of Porcacchi
(p. 105) served for many successive editions.
Another plan of the same year showing
an oval lake surrounding the town, is found in
Braun and Hogenberg’s <i>Civitates orbis terrarum</i>
(Cologne, 1572), and of later dates, and the
French edition, <i>Théâtre des cités du monde</i> (Brussels,
1574), i. 59. A similar outline characterizes
the small woodcut (6×6 inches) which
is found in Münster’s <i>Cosmographia</i> (1598),
p. dccccxiiii.</p>

<p class="pf400">Later views and plans appeared in Gottfriedt’s
<i>Newe Welt</i> (1655); in Solis’s <i>Conquista</i>
(1704), p. 261, reproduced in the English edition
of 1724; in La Croix’ <i>Algemeene Weereld Beschryving</i>
(1705); in Herrera (edition of 1728),
p. 399; in Clavigero (1780), giving the lake
and the town (copied in Verne’s <i>De’couverte de
la Terre</i>, p. 248), and also a map of Anahuac,
both reproduced in the London (1787) and
Philadelphia (1817) editions, as well as in the
Spanish edition published at Mexico in 1844;

lake is given an indefinite extension; in Keating’s
edition of Bernal Diaz, besides engraved

<p class="pf400">The account of Mexico in 1554 written by
Francisco Cervantes Salazar, and republished
with annotations by Icazbalceta in 1875 (Carter-Brown,
i. 595) is helpful in this study of the
ancient town. Cf. “Mexico et ses environs en

<p>Still the Aztec King, Quauhtemotzin, scorned to
yield; and the slaughter went on from day to day, till finally, on the 13th
of August, 1521, the end came. The royal Aztec was captured, trying to
escape in a boat; and there was no one left to fight. Of the thousand Spaniards
who had done the work about a tenth had succumbed; and probably
something like the same proportion among the many thousand allies. The
Mexican loss must have been far greater, perhaps several times greater.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a>
The Spaniards were no sooner in possession than quarrels began over the
booty. Far less was found than was hoped for, and torture was applied,
with no success, to discover the hiding-places. The captive prince was
not spared this indignity. Cortés was accused of appropriating an undue
share of what was found, and hot feelings for a while prevailed.</p>

<p>The conquest now had to be maintained by the occupation of the country;
and the question was debated whether to build the new capital on the
ruins of Mexico, or to establish it at Tezcuco or Coyohuacan. Cortés preferred
the prestige of the traditional site, and so the new Spanish town rose
on the ruins of the Aztec capital; the Spanish quarter being formed about
the square of Tenochtitlan (known in the early books usually as Temixtitan),
which was separated by a wide canal from the Indian settlement
clustered about Tlatelulco. Two additional causeways were constructed,
and the Aztec aqueduct was restored. Inducements were offered to neighboring
tribes to settle in the city, and districts were assigned to them.
Thus were hewers of wood and drawers of water abundantly secured. But
Mexico never regained with the natives the dominance which the Aztecs
had given it. Its population was smaller, and a similar decadence marked
the fate of the other chief towns; Spanish rule and disease checked their
growth. Even Tezcuco and Tlascala soon learned what it was to be the
dependents of the conquerors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>Cortés speedily decided upon further conquests. The Aztec tribute-rolls
told him of the comparative wealth of the provinces, and the turbulent
spirits among his men were best controlled in campaigns. He needed
powder, so he sent some bold men to the crater of Popocatepetl to get
sulphur. They secured it, but did not repeat the experiment. Cortés
also needed cannon. The Aztecs had no iron, but sufficient copper; and
finding a tin mine, his craftsmen made a gun-metal, which soon increased
his artillery to a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>Expeditions were now despatched hither and thither, and province after
province succumbed. Other regions sent in their princes and chief men
with gifts and words of submission. The reports which came back of the
great southern sea opened new visions; and Cortés sent expeditions to
find ports and build vessels; and thus Zacalula grew up. Revolts here
and there followed the Spanish occupancy, but they were all promptly
suppressed.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, Cortés had to face a new enemy. Fonseca,
as patron of Velasquez, had taken occasion in the absence of the Emperor,
attending to the affairs of his German domain, to order Cristóbal de
Tapia from Hispaniola to take command in New Spain and to investigate
the doings of Cortés. He arrived in December, 1521, with a single vessel
at Villa Rica, and was guardedly received by Gonzalo de Alvarado, there
in command. Tapia now despatched a messenger to Cortés, who replied
with many blandishments, and sent Sandoval and others as a council to
confer with Tapia, taking care to have among its members a majority of
his most loyal adherents.</p>

<p>They met Dec. 12, 1521, and the conference lasted till Jan. 6, 1522. It
resulted in a determination to hold the orders borne by Tapia in abeyance
till the Emperor himself could be heard. Tapia protested in vain, and
was quickly hustled out of the country. He was not long gone when new
orders for him arrived,&mdash;this time under the sign-manual of the Emperor
himself. This increased the perplexity; but Cortés won the messenger in
his golden fashion. Shortly afterwards the same messenger set off for
Spain, carrying back the letters with him. These occurrences did not
escape notice throughout the country, and Cortés was put to the necessity
of extreme measures to restore his prestige; while in his letter to the
Emperor he threw the responsibility of his action upon the council, who
felt it necessary, he alleged, to take the course they did to make good the
gains which had already been effected for the Emperor. In a spirit of
conciliation, however, Cortés released Narvaez, who had been confined
at Villa Rica; and so in due time another enemy found his way to Spain,
and joined the cabal against the Conqueror of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring (1522) Cortés was cheered by a report from the <i>Audiencia</i>
of Santo Domingo, confirming his acts and promising intercession with the
Emperor. To support this intercession, Cortés despatched to Spain some
friends with his third letter, dated at Coyohuacan May 15, 1522. These
agents carried also a large store of propitiatory treasure. Two of the
vessels, which held most of it, were captured by French corsairs,<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> and the
Spanish gains enriched the coffers of Francis I. rather than those of
Charles V. The despatches of Cortés, however, reached their destination,
though Fonseca and the friends of Velasquez had conspired to prevent
their delivery, and had even appropriated some part of the treasure which
a third vessel had securely landed. Thus there were charges and countercharges,
and Charles summoned a council to investigate. Cortés won.
Velasquez, Fonseca, and Narvaez were all humiliated in seeing their great
rival made, by royal command, governor and captain-general of New
Spain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cortés, hearing of a proposed expedition under Garay to
take possession of the region north of Villa Rica, conducted a force himself
to seize, in advance, that province known as Pánuco, and to subjugate
the Huastecs who dwelt there. This was done. The plunder proved
small; but this disappointment was forgotten in the news which now, for
the first time, reached Cortés of his late success in Spain. The whole
country was jubilant over the recognition of his merit; and opportunely
came embassies from Guatemala bringing costlier tributes than the Spaniards
had ever seen before. This turned their attention to the south.
There was apprehension that the Spaniards who were already at Panamá
might sooner reach these rich regions, and might earlier find the looked-for
passage from the Gulf to the south sea. To anticipate them, no time
could be lost. So Alvarado, Olid, and Sandoval were given commands to
push explorations and conquests southward and on either shore. Before
the expeditions started, news came that Garay, arriving from Jamaica, had
landed with a force at Pánuco to seize that region in the interests of the
Velasquez faction. The mustered forces were at once combined under
Cortés’ own lead, and marched against Garay,&mdash;Alvarado in advance.
Before Cortés was ready to start, he was relieved from the necessity of
going in person by the receipt of a royal order from Spain confirming him
in the possession of Pánuco and forbidding Garay to occupy any of Cortés’
possessions. This order was hurriedly despatched to Alvarado; but it
did not reach him till he had made some captives of the intruders. Garay
readily assented to lead his forces farther north if restitution should be
made to him of the captives and munitions which Alvarado had taken.
This was not so easily done, for plunder in hand was doubly rich, and
Garay’s own men preferred to enlist with Cortés. To compose matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Garay went to Mexico, where Cortés received him with ostentatious
kindness, and promised him assistance in his northern conquests. In the
midst of Cortés’ hospitality his guest sickened and died, and was buried
with pomp.</p>

<p>While Garay was in Mexico, his men at Pánuco, resenting the control of
Garay’s son, who had been left in charge of them, committed such ravages
on the country that the natives rose on them, and were so rapidly annihilating
them that Alvarado, who had left, was sent back to check the outbreak.
He encountered much opposition; but conquered as usual, and punished
afterward the chief ringleaders with abundant cruelty. Such of Garay’s
men as would, joined the forces of Cortés, while the rest were sent back
to Jamaica.</p>

<p>The thoughts of Cortés were now turned to his plan of southern exploration,
and early in December Alvarado was on his way to Guatemala.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>
Desperate fighting and the old success attended Cortés’ lieutenant, and the
Quiché army displayed their valor in vain in battle after battle. It was the
old story of cavalry and arquebusiers. As Alvarado approached Utatlan,
the Quiché capital, he learned of a plot to entrap him in the city, which
was to be burned about his ears. By a counterplot he seized the Quiché
nobles, and burned them and their city. By the aid of the Cakchiquels
he devastated the surrounding country. Into the territory of this friendly
people he next marched, and was received royally by King Sinacam in his
city of Patinamit (Guatemala), and was soon engaged with him in an
attack on his neighbors, the Zutugils, who had lately abetted an insurrection
among Sinacam’s vassals. Alvarado beat them, of course, and established
a fortified post among them after they had submitted, as gracefully
as they could. With Quichés and Cakchiquels now in his train, Alvarado
still went on, burned towns and routed the country’s defenders, till, the
rainy season coming on, he withdrew his crusaders and took up his quarters
once more at Patinamit, late in July, 1524. From this place he sent
despatches to Cortés, who forwarded two hundred more Spanish soldiers
for further campaigns.</p>

<p>The Spanish extortions produced the usual results. The Cakchiquels
turned under the abuse, deserted their city, and prepared for a campaign.
The Spaniards found them abler foes than any yet encountered. The
Cakchiquels devastated the country on which Alvarado depended for supplies,
and the Spaniards found themselves reduced to great straits. It was
only after receiving reinforcements sent by Cortés that Alvarado was
enabled to push his conquests farther, and possess himself of the redoubtable
fortress of Mixco and successfully invade the Valley of Zacatepec.</p>

<p class="p2">The expedition to Honduras was intrusted to Cristóbal de Olid, and
started about a month after Alvarado’s to Guatemala. Olid was given a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
fleet; and a part of his instructions was to search for a passage to the great
south sea. He sailed from the port now known as Vera Cruz on the 11th
of January, 1524, and directed his course for Havana, where he was to find
munitions and horses, for the purchase of which agents had already been
sent thither by Cortés. While in Cuba the blandishments of Velasquez
had worked upon Olid’s vanity, and when he sailed for Honduras he was
harboring thoughts of defection. Not long after he landed he openly
announced them, and gained the adherence of most of his men. Cortés,
who had been warned from Cuba of Olid’s purpose, sent some vessels after
him, which were wrecked. Thus Casas, their commander, and his men fell
into Olid’s hands. After an interval, an opportunity offering, the captive
leader conspired to kill Olid. He wounded and secured him, brought him
to a form of trial, and cut off his head. Leaving a lieutenant to conduct
further progress, Casas started to go to Mexico and make report to Cortés.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, with a prescience of the mischief brewing, and impelled by
his restless nature, Cortés had determined to march overland to Honduras;
and in the latter part of October, 1524, he set out. He started with great
state; but the difficulties of the way made his train a sorry sight as they
struggled through morass after morass, stopped by river after river, which
they were under the necessity of fording or bridging. All the while their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
provisions grew less and less. To add to the difficulties, some Mexican chieftains,
who had been taken along as hostages for the security of Mexico, had
conspired to kill Cortés, and then to march with their followers back to Mexico
as deliverers. The plot was discovered, and the leaders were executed.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>
Some of the towns passed by the army had been deserted by their inhabitants,
without leaving any provisions behind. Guides which they secured
ran away. On they went, however, hardly in a condition to confront Olid,
should he appear, and they were now approaching his province. At last
some Spaniards were met, who told them of Casas’ success; and the hopes
of Cortés rose. He found the settlers at Nito, who had been decimated by
malaria, now engaged in constructing a vessel in which to depart. His coming
cheered them; and a ship opportunely appearing in the harbor with provisions,
Cortés purchased her and her lading. He then took steps to move
the settlement to a more salubrious spot. Using the newly acquired vessel,
he explored the neighboring waters, hoping to find the passage to the south
sea; and making some land expeditions, he captured several pueblos, and
learned, from a native of the Pacific coast whom he fell in with, that
Alvarado was conducting his campaign not far away. Finally, he passed
on to Trujillo, where he found the colony of Olid’s former adherents, and
confirmed the dispositions which Casas had made, while he sent vessels to
Cuba and Jamaica for supplies.</p>

<p>At this juncture Cortés got bad news from Mexico. Cabal and anti-cabal
among those left in charge of the government were having their
effect. When a report reached them of the death of Cortés and the loss
of his army, it was the signal for the bad spirits to rise, seize the government,
and apportion the estates of the absentees. The most steadfast
friend of Cortés&mdash;Zuazo&mdash;was sent off to Cuba, whence he got the news
to Cortés by letter. After some hesitation and much saying of Masses,
Cortés appointed a governor for the Honduras colony; and sending
Sandoval with his forces overland, he embarked himself to go by sea.
Various mishaps caused his ship to put back several times. Discouraged
at last, and believing there was a divine purpose in keeping him in
Honduras for further conquest, he determined to remain a while, and sent
messengers instead to Mexico. Runners were also sent after Sandoval to
bring him back.</p>

<p>Cortés now turned his attention to the neighboring provinces; and one
after another he brought them into subjection, or gained their respect by
interfering to protect them from other parties of marauding Spaniards.
He had already planned conquests farther south, and Sandoval had received
orders to march, when a messenger from Mexico brought the exhortations
of his friends for his return to that city. Taking a small force with him,
including Sandoval, he embarked in April, 1526. After being tempest-tossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and driven to Cuba, he landed late in May near Vera Cruz, and
proceeded in triumph to his capital.</p>

<p>Cortés’ messenger from Honduras had arrived in good time, and had
animated his steadfast adherents, who succeeded very soon in overthrowing
the usurper Salazar and restoring the Cortés government. Then followed
the request for Cortés’ return, and in due time his arrival. The natives
vied with each other in the consideration which they showed to Malinche,
as Cortés was universally called by them. Safe in their good wishes,
Cortés moved by easy stages toward Mexico. Everybody was astir with
shout and banner as he entered the city itself. He devoted himself at once
to re-establishing the government and correcting abuses.</p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile the enemies of Cortés at Madrid had so impressed the
Emperor that he ordered a judge, Luis Ponce de Leon, to proceed to
Mexico and investigate the charges against the Governor, and to hold
power during the suspension of Cortés’ commission. Cortés received him
loyally, and the transfer of authority was duly made,&mdash;Cortés still retaining
the position of captain-general. Before any charges against Cortés could
be heard, Ponce sickened and died, July 20, 1526; and his authority
descended to Marcos de Aguilar, whom he had named as successor. He
too died in a short time; and Cortés had to resist the appeals of his
friends, who wished him to reassume the governorship and quiet the commotions
which these sudden changes were producing. Meanwhile the
enemies of Cortés were actively intriguing in Spain, and Estrada received
a royal decree to assume alone the government, which with two others he
had been exercising since the death of Aguilar. The patience of Cortés
and his adherents was again put to a test when the new ruler directed
the exile of Cortés from the city. Estrada soon saw his mistake, and made
advances for a reconciliation, which Cortés accepted.</p>

<p>But new developments were taking place on the coast. The Emperor
had taken Pánuco out of Cortés’ jurisdiction by appointing Nuño de
Guzman to govern it, with orders to support Ponce if Cortés should resist
that royal agent. Guzman did not arrive on the coast till May 20, 1527,
when he soon, by his acts, indicated his adherence to the Velasquez party,
and a disposition to encroach upon the bounds of New Spain. He was
forced to deal with Cortés as captain-general; and letters far from conciliatory
in character passed from Guzman to the authorities in Mexico.
Estrada had found it necessary to ask Cortés to conduct a campaign against
his ambitious neighbor; but Cortés felt that he could do more for himself
and New Spain in the Old, and so prepared to leave the country and
escape from the urgency of those of his partisans who were constantly
trying to embroil him with Estrada. A letter from the new President
of the Council of the Indies urging his coming, helped much to the
determination. He collected what he could of treasure, fabric, and implement
to show the richness of the country. A great variety of animals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
representatives of the various subjugated peoples, and a showy train of
dependents, among them such conspicuous characters as Sandoval and
Tapia, with native princes and chieftains, accompanied him on board the
vessels.</p>

<p class="p2">Cortés, meanwhile, was ignorant of what further mischief his enemies
had done in Spain. The Emperor had appointed a commission (<i>audiencia</i>)
to examine the affairs of New Spain, and had placed Guzman at the head.
It had full power to
assume the government
and regulate the
administration. In
December, 1528, and
January, 1529, all the
members assembled at
Mexico. The jealous
and grasping quality
of their rule was soon
apparent. The absence
of Cortés in
Spain threatened the
continuance of their
power; for reports had
reached Mexico of the
enthusiasm which attended
his arrival in
Spain. They accordingly
despatched messengers
to the Spanish
court renewing the
charges against Cortés,
and setting forth the danger of his return to Mexico. Alvarado and
other friends of Cortés protested in vain, and had to look on and see, under
one pretext or another, all sorts of taxes and burdens laid upon the estates
of the absent hero. He was also indicted in legal form for every vice and
crime that any one might choose to charge him with; and the indictments
stood against him for many years.</p>

<p>Guzman was soon aware of the smouldering hatred which the rule of
himself and his associate had created; and he must have had suspicions
of the representations of his rapacity and cruelty which were reaching
Madrid from his opponents. To cover all iniquities with the splendor
of conquest, he gathered a formidable army and marched to invade the
province of Jalisco.</p>

<p>Cortés, with his following, had landed at Palos late in 1528, and was
under the necessity, a few days later, of laying the body of Sandoval&mdash;worn
out with the Honduras campaign&mdash;in the vaults of La Rabida. It was
a sad duty for Cortés, burdened with the grief that his young lieutenant
could not share with him the honors now in store, as he made his
progress to Toledo, where the Court then was. He was received with
unaccustomed honor and royal condescensions,&mdash;only the prelude to
substantial grants of territory in New Spain, which he was asked to particularize
and describe. He was furthermore honored with the station
and title of Marqués del Valle de Oajaca. He was confirmed as captain-general;
but his reinstatement as governor was deferred till the reports of
the new commission in New Spain should be received. He was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
assured of liberty to make discoveries in the south sea, and to act as

<p>The wife of Cortés, whom he had left in Cuba, had joined him in Mexico
after the conquest, and had been received with becoming state. Her early
decease, after a loftier alliance would have become helpful to his ambition,
had naturally raised a suspicion among Cortés’ traducers that her death
had been prematurely hastened.</p>

<p>He had now honors sufficient for any
match among the rank of grandees; and a few days after he was ennobled
he was married, as had been earlier planned, to the daughter of
the late Conde de Aguilar and niece of the Duque de Béjar,&mdash;both
houses of royal extraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>Cortés now prepared to return to Mexico with his new titles. He learned
that the Emperor had appointed a new <i>audiencia</i> to proceed thither, and
it promised him better justice than he had got from the other. The
Emperor was not, however, satisfied as yet that the presence of Cortés
in Mexico was advisable at the present juncture, and he ordered him to
stay; but the decree was too late, and Cortés, with a great retinue, had
already departed. He landed at Vera Cruz, in advance of the new judge,
July 15, 1530.</p>

<p>His reception was as joyous as it had been four years before; and though
an order had reached him forbidding his approach within ten leagues of
Mexico till the new <i>audiencia</i> should arrive, the support of his retinue compelled
him to proceed to Tezcuco, where he awaited its coming, while he
was put in the interim to not a little hazard and inconvenience by the efforts
of the Guzman government to deprive him of sustenance and limit his
intercourse with the natives.</p>

<p>Near the end of the year the new Government arrived,&mdash;or all but its
president, Fuenleal, for he was the Bishop of Santo Domingo, whom the
others had been
ordered to take
on board their
vessel on the
way; but stress
of weather had
prevented their
doing this.
The Bishop did
not join them
till September.
In Mexico they
took possession
of Cortés’ house, which they had been instructed to appropriate at an
appraisement.</p>

<p>The former Government was at once put on trial, and judgment was in
most cases rendered against them, so that their property did not suffice to
meet the fines imposed. Cortés got a due share of what they were made
to disgorge, in restitution of his own losses through them. Innumerable
reforms were instituted, and the natives received greater protection than
ever before.</p>

<p>Guzman, meanwhile, was on his expedition toward the Pacific coast,
conducting his rapacious and brutal conquest of Nueva Galicia. He refused
to obey the call of the new <i>audiencia</i>, while he despatched messengers
to Mexico to protect, if possible, his interests. By them also he forwarded
his own statement of his case to the Emperor. Cortés, vexed at Guzman’s
anticipation of his own intended discoveries toward the Pacific, sent a
lieutenant to confront him; but Guzman was wily enough to circumvent
the lieutenant, seized him, and packed him off to Mexico with scorn and
assurance.</p>

<p>It was his last hour of triumph. His force soon dwindled;
his adherents deserted him; his misdeeds had left him no friends; and he
at last deserted the remnant of his army, and starting for Pánuco, turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
aside to Mexico on the way. He found in the city a new <i>régime</i>. Antonio
de Mendoza had been sent out as viceroy, and to succeed Fuenleal at the
same time as president of the <i>audiencia</i>. He had arrived at Vera Cruz in
October, 1535. His rule was temperate and cautious. Negroes, who had
been imported into the country in large numbers as slaves, plotted an
insurrection: but the Viceroy suppressed it; and if there was native complicity
in the attempt, it was not proved. The Viceroy had received from
his predecessors a source of trial and confusion in the disputed relations
which existed between the civil rulers and the Captain-General. There
were endless disputes with the second <i>audiencia</i>, and disagreements continued
to exist with the Viceroy, about the respective limits of the powers
of the two as derived from the Emperor.</p>

<p>Cortés had been at great expense in endeavoring to prosecute discovery
in the Pacific, and he had the vexation of seeing his efforts continually
embarrassed by the new powers. Previous to his departure for Spain he
had despatched vessels from Tehuantepec to the Moluccas to open traffic
with the Asiatic Indies; but the first <i>audiencia</i> had prevented the despatch
of a succoring expedition which Cortés had planned. On his return to
New Spain the Captain-General had begun the construction of new vessels
both at Tehuantepec and at Acapulco; but the second <i>audiencia</i> interfered
with his employment of Indians to carry his material to the coast. He
however contrived to despatch two vessels up the coast under Hurtado de
Mendoza, which left in May, 1532. They had reached the coast to the
north, where Guzman was marauding, who was glad of the opportunity of
thwarting the purpose of his rival. He refused the vessels the refuge of a
harbor, and they were subsequently lost. Cortés now resolved to give his
personal attention to these sea explorations, and proceeding to Tehuantepec,
he superintended the construction of two vessels, which finally left
port Oct. 29, 1533. They discovered Lower California. Afterward one of
the vessels was separated from the other, and fell in distress into the hands
of Guzman while making a harbor on the coast. The other ship reached
Tehuantepec. Cortés appealed to the <i>audiencia</i>, who meted equal justice
in ordering Guzman to surrender the vessel, and in commanding Cortés to desist
from further exploration. An appeal to the Emperor effected little, for
it seems probable that the <i>audiencia</i> knew what support it had at court.
Cortés next resolved to act on his own responsibility and take command
in person of a third expedition.</p>

<p>So, in the winter of 1534-1535, he sent
some vessels up the coast, and led a land force in the same direction.
Guzman fled before him. Cortés joined his fleet at the port where Guzman
had seized his ship on the earlier voyage, and embarked. Crossing to the
California peninsula, he began the settlement of a colony on its eastern shore.
He left the settlers there, and returned to Acapulco to send forward additional
supplies and recruits.</p>

The picture in the Hospital is also said to
be a copy of one taken in Spain a few years before
the death of Cortés, during his last visit. The
original is not known to exist. The present
descendants of the Conqueror, the family of the
Duke of Monteleone in Italy, have only a copy
of the one at Mexico. Another copy, made
during General Scott’s occupation of the city, is
in the gallery of the Pennsylvania Historical
Society (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 130). The upper part

<p>At this juncture the new Viceroy had reached
Mexico; and it was not long before he began to entertain schemes of
despatching fleets of discovery, and Cortés found a new rival in his plans.
The Captain-General got the start of his rival, and sent out a new expedition
from Acapulco under Francisco de Ulloa; but the Viceroy gave orders
to prevent other vessels
following, and his
officers seized one already
at sea, which
chanced to put into
one of the upper ports.
Cortés could endure
such thraldom no longer,
and early in 1540
he left again for Spain
to plead his interests
with the Emperor.
He never saw the land
of his conquest again.</p>

<p>We left Guzman for
a while in Mexico,
where Mendoza not
unkindly received
him, as one who hated
Cortés as much or
more than he did.
Guzman was bent on
escaping, and had ordered
a vessel to be
ready on the coast.
He was a little too late,
however. The Emperor
had sent a judge
to call him to account,
and Guzman suddenly
found this evil genius
was in Mexico. The
judge put him under
arrest and marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
him to prison. A trial was begun; but it dragged along, and Guzman
sent an appeal forward to the Council for the Indies, in which he charged
Cortés with promoting his persecution. He was in the end remanded to
Spain, where he lingered out a despised life for a few years, with a gleam
of satisfaction, perhaps, in finding,
some time after, that Cortés too had
found a longer stay in New Spain
unprofitable.</p>

<p>Cortés had reached Spain in the
early part of 1540, and had been received
with honor by the Court; but
when he began to press for a judgment
that might restore his losses
and rehabilitate him in his self-respect,
he found nothing but refusal and
procrastination. He asked to return
to Mexico, but found he could not.
With a reckless aim he joined an
expedition against Algiers; but the
ship on which he embarked was
wrecked, and he only saved himself
by swimming, losing the choicest of his Mexican jewels, which he carried
on his person. Then again he memorialized the Emperor for a hearing
and award, but was disregarded. Later he once more appealed, but was
still unheard. Again he asked permission to return to New Spain. This
time it was granted; but before he could make the final preparations, he
sank under his burdens, and at a village near Seville Cortés died on the 2d
of December, 1547, in his sixty-second year.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<h3><a name="c397" id="c397">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE DOCUMENTARY SOURCES OF
MEXICAN HISTORY.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">MR. H. H. BANCROFT, in speaking of the facilities which writers of Spanish
American history now have in excess of those enjoyed by the historian of thirty
years ago, claims that in documentary evidence there are twenty papers for his use in
print to-day for one then.<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> These are found in part in the great <i>Coleccion</i> of Pacheco
and others mentioned in the Introduction. The Mexican writer Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta
(born 1825) made a most important contribution in the two volumes of a <i>Coleccion
de documentos para la historia de México</i> which
passes by his name and which appeared respectively
in 1858 and 1866.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> He found in Mexico few
of the papers which he printed, obtaining them
chiefly from Spain.</p>

<div class="floatright">

</div>

<p>Of great interest among those
which he gives is the <i>Itinerario</i> of Grijalva, both in
the Italian and Spanish text.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> Of Cortés himself
there are in this publication various letters not
earlier made public. The quarrel between him
and Velasquez is illustrated by other papers. Here also we find what is mentioned elsewhere
as “De rebus gestis Cortesii” printed as a “Vida de Cortés,” and attributed
to C. Calvet de Estrella. The recital of the so-called “Anonymous Conqueror,” held by
some to be Francisco de Terrazas, is translated from Ramusio (the original Spanish is
not known), with a fac-simile of the plan of Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> There is also the letter from the
army of Cortés to the Emperor; and in the second volume various other papers interesting
in connection with Cortés’ career, including the memorial of Luis de Cárdenas, etc.
Two other papers have been recognized as important. One of these in the first volume
is the <i>Historia de los Indios de Nueva España</i> of Fray Toribio Motolinia, accompanied
by a Life of the Father by Ramirez, with a gathering of bibliographical detail.
Toribio de Benavente&mdash;Motolinia was a name which he took from a description of him
by the natives&mdash;had come over with the Franciscans in 1523. He was a devoted, self-sacrificing
missionary; but he proved that his work did not quiet all the passions, for
he became a violent opponent of Las Casas’ views and measures.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> His labors took him
the length and breadth of the land; his assiduity acquired for him a large knowledge
of the Aztec tongue and beliefs; and his work, besides describing institutions of this
people, tells of the success and methods secured or adopted by himself and his companions
in effecting their conversion to the faith of the conquerors. Robertson used a
manuscript copy of the work, and Obadiah Rich procured a copy for Prescott, who
ventured the assertion, when he wrote, that it had so little of popular interest that it
would never probably be printed.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> calls the <i>Relacion</i> of Andrés de Tápia one of the most valuable documents
of the early parts of the Conquest. It ends with the capture of Narvaez; recounting
the antecedent events, however, with “uneven completeness.” It is written warmly in the
interests of Cortés. Icazbalceta got what seemed to be the original from the Library of
the Academy of History in Madrid, and printed it in his second volume (p. 554). It
was not known to Prescott, who quotes it at second hand in Gomara.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p>The next most important collection is that published in Mexico from 1852 to 1857,<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a>
under the general title of <i>Documentos para la historia de México</i>. This collection of
four series, reckoned variously in nineteen or twenty-one volumes, is chiefly derived
from Mexican sources, and is largely illustrative of the history of northwestern Mexico,
and in general concerns Mexican history of a period posterior to the Conquest.</p>

<p>There have been two important series of documents published and in part unearthed
by José Fernando Ramirez, who became Minister of State under Maximilian. The first
of these is the testimony at the examination of the charges which were brought against
Pedro de Alvarado, and some of those made in respect to Nuño de Guzman,&mdash;<i>Procesos de
residencia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> which was published in Mexico in 1847;<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> the other set of documents pertain
to the trial of Cortés himself. Such of these as were found in the Mexican Archives
were edited by Ignacio L. Rayon under the title of <i>Archivo Mexicano; Documentos para
la historia de México</i>, and published in the city of Mexico in 1852-1853, in two volumes.
At a later day (1867-1868) Ramirez discovered in the Spanish Archives other considerable
portions of the same trial, and these have been printed in the <i>Coleccion de documentos
inéditos de las Indias</i>, vols. xxvi.-xxix.</p>

<p>The records of the municipality of Mexico date from March 8, 1524, and chronicle
for a long time the sessions as held in Cortés’ house; and are particularly interesting,
as Bancroft says,<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> after 1524, when we no longer have Cortés’ own letters to follow, down
to 1529. Harrisse has told us what he found in the repositories of Italy, particularly at
Venice, among the letters sent to the Senate during this period by the Venetian ambassadors
at Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> Three volumes have so far been published of a <i>Coleccion de documentos
para la historia de Costa-Rica</i> at San José de Costa-Rica, under the editing of
León Fernández, which have been drawn from the Archives of the Indies and from
the repositories in Guatemala. A few letters of Alvarado and other letters of the
Conquest period are found in the <i>Coleccion de documentos antiguous de Guatemala</i>
published at Guatemala in 1857.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

<p>No more voluminous contributor to the monographic and documentary history of
Mexico can be named than Carlos Maria de Bustamante. There will be occasion in other
connections to dwell upon particular publications, and some others are of little interest
to us at present, referring to periods as late as the present century. Bustamante
was a Spaniard, but he threw himself with characteristic energy into a heated advoracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
of national Mexican feelings; and this warmly partisan exhibition of himself did
much toward rendering the gathering of his scattered writings very difficult, in view of
the enemies whom he made and of their ability to suppress obnoxious publications when
they came into power. Most of these works date from 1812 to 1850, and when collected
make nearly or quite fifty volumes, though frequently bound in fewer.<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> The completest list,
however, is probably that included in the enumeration of authorities prefixed by Bancroft to
his <i>Central America</i> and <i>Mexico</i>, which shows not only the printed works of Bustamante,
but also the autograph originals,&mdash;which, Bancroft says, contain much not in the published
works.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> Indeed, these lists show an extremely full equipment of the manuscript documentary
stores relating to the whole period of Mexican history,<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> including a copy of the
<i>Archivo general de México</i>, as well as much from the catalogues of José Maria Andrade
and José Fernando Ramirez, records of the early Mexican councils, and much else of an
ecclesiastical and missionary character not yet put in print.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Of particular value for the documents which it includes is the <i>Historia de la fundacion
y discurso de la provincia de Santiago de México, de la orden de predicadores, por las
vidas de sus varones insignes y casos notables de Nueva España</i>, published in Madrid in
1596.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> The author, Davilla Padilla, was born in Mexico in 1562 of good stock; he became
a Dominican in 1579, and died in 1604. His opportunities for gathering material
were good, and he has amassed a useful store of information regarding the contact of
the Spanish and the Indians, and the evidences of the national traits of the natives. His
book has another interest, in that we find in it the earliest mention of the establishment
of a press in Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the earliest of the modern collections of documents and early monographs is
the <i>Historiadores primitivos de las Indias occidentales</i> of Andres Gonzales de Barcia
Carballido y Zuniga (known usually as Barcia), published at Madrid in 1749 in three volumes
folio, and enriched with the editor’s notes. The sections were published separately;
and it was not till after the editor’s death (1743) that they were grouped and put out
collectively with the above distinctive title. In this form the collection is rare, and it has
been stated that not over one or two hundred copies were so gathered.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<p class="p2">First among all documents respecting the Conquest are the letters sent by Cortés
himself to the Emperor; and of these a somewhat detailed bibliographical account is
given in the Notes following this Essay, as well as an examination of the corrective value
of certain other contemporaneous and later writers.</p>

<h3><a name="c402" id="c402">NOTES.</a></h3>

<p class="p2"><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">The Letters of Cortés.</span>&mdash;I. <i>The Lost
First Letter</i>, <i>July</i> 10, 1519. The series of letters
which Cortés sent to the Emperor is supposed
to have begun with one dated at Vera Cruz in
July, 1519, which is now lost, but which Barcia
and Wilson suppose to have been suppressed
by the Council of the Indies at the request of
Narvaez. There are contemporaneous references
to show that it once existed. Cortés himself
mentions it in his second letter, and Bernal
Diaz implies that it was not shown by Cortés to
his companions. Gomara mentions it, and is
thought to give its purport in brief. Thinking
that Charles V. may have carried it to Germany,
Robertson caused the Vienna Archives to be
searched, but without avail; though it has been
the belief that this letter existed there at one
time, and another sent with it is known to be in
those Archives. Prescott caused thorough examinations
of the repositories of London, Paris,
and Madrid to be made,&mdash;equally without
result.</p>

<p>Fortunately the same vessel took two other
letters, one of which we have. This was addressed
by the <i>justicia y regimiento</i> of La Villa
Rica de la Vera Cruz, and was dated July 10,
1519. It was discovered, by Robertson’s agency,
in the Imperial Library at Vienna. It rehearses
the discoveries of Córdoba and Grijalva, and
sustains the views of Cortés, who charged Velasquez
with being incompetent and dishonest.
This letter is sometimes counted as the first
of the series; for though it was not written by
Cortés, he is thought to have inspired it.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a></p>

<p>The other letter is known only through the
use of it which contemporary writers made.
It was from some of the leading companions in
arms of Cortés, who, while they praised their
commander, had something to say of others
not quite to the satisfaction of Cortés. The
Conqueror, it is intimated, intrigued to prevent
its reaching the Emperor,&mdash;which may account
for its loss. Las Casas and Tapia both mention
it.<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p>Beside the account given in Gomara of
Cortés’ early life and his doings in the New
World up to the time of his leaving Cuba in
1519, there is a contemporary narrative, quite in
Cortés’ interest, of unknown authorship, which
was found by Muñoz at Simancas.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> The Latin
version is called “De rebus gestis Ferdinandi
Cortesii;” but it is called “Vida de Hernan
Cortés” in the Spanish rendering which is given
by Icazbalceta in his <i>Coleccion de documentos</i>, i.
309-357.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p>A publication of Peter Martyr at Basle in
1521 is often taken as a substitute for the lost
first epistle of Cortés. This is the <i>De nuper sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
D. Carolo repertis insulis ... Petri Martyris
enchiridion</i>, which gives a narrative of the expeditions
of Grijalva and Cortés, as a sort of
supplement to what Peter Martyr had written on
the affairs of the Indies in his Three Decades.
It was afterward included in his Basle edition
of 1533 and in the Paris <i>Extraict</i> of 1532.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

of Cortés and a description of those
of Córdoba and Grijalva, in <i>Ein Auszug ettlicher

<p class="p2">II. <i>The Second Letter, Oct. 30, 1520.</i> We
possess four early editions of this,&mdash;two Spanish
(1, 2) and one Latin (3), and one Italian (4).</p>

<p>1. The earliest Spanish edition was published
at Seville Nov. 8, 1522, as <i>Carta de relaciō</i>, having
twenty-eight leaves, in gothic type.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a></p>

<p>2. The second Spanish edition, <i>Carta de relacion</i>,
was printed at Saragossa in 1524. It is in
gothic letter, twenty-eight leaves, and has a cut
of Cortés before Charles V. and his Court, of
which a reduced fac-simile is herewith given.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a></p>

folio at Nuremberg, in August, 1524, in roman

entitled: <i>Præclara Ferdinādi Cortesii de noua

jugglers sent to Rome by Cortés. The Conqueror also made His Holiness other more substantial supplications
for his favor, which resulted in Cortés receiving plenary indulgence for his and his companions’ sins
(Prescott, iii. 299).</p>

<p>4. The Italian edition, <i>La preclara narratione
di Ferdinando Cortese della Nuova Hispagna del
Mare Oceano ... per Nicolo Liburnio con fidelta...
tradotta</i>, was printed at Venice in 1524.
It follows the Latin version of Savorgnanus,
and includes also the third letter.</p>

<p>This edition has a new engraving of the map
in the Nuremberg edition, though Quaritch and
others have doubted if such a map belongs to it.
Leclerc (no. 151) chronicles copies with and
without the map.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> An abstract of the second

<p>There were other contemporary abstracts of
this letter. Sigmund Grimm, of Augsburg, is
said to be the author of one, published about
1522 or 1523, called <i>Ein schöne newe Zeytung,
so kayserlich Mayestet auss India yetz newlich
zūckommen seind</i>. It is cited in Harrisse and
the <i>Bibliotheca Grenvilliana</i>; and Ternaux (no.
5) is thought to err in assigning the date of 1520
to it, as if printed in Augsburg. Of about the
same date is another described by Sabin (vol. iv.
no. 16,952) as printed at Antwerp, and called
<i>Tressacree Imperiale et Catholique Mageste ...
eust nouvelles des marches ysles et terre ferme
occeanes</i>. This seems to be based, according to
Brunet, <i>Supplément</i> (vol. i. col. 320), on the first
and second letters, beginning with the departure,
in 1519, from Vera Cruz, and ending with the
death of Montezuma.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<p>The second letter forms part of various
collected editions, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>In Spanish.</i> Bancroft (<i>Mexico</i>, i. 543) notes
the second and third letters as being published
in the Spanish <i>Thesóro de virtudes</i> in 1543.</p>

<p>Barcia’s <i>Historiadores primitivos</i> (1749); also
edited by Enrique de Vedia, Madrid, 1852-1853.</p>

<p><i>Historia de Nueva España, escrita por su esclarecido
Conquistador Hernan Cortés, aumentada
con otros documentos y notas por Don Francisco
Antonio Lorenzana, arzobispo de México</i>, Mexico,
1770. This important work, embracing the
second, third, and fourth letters, has a large view
of the great temple of Mexico, a map of New
Spain,<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> and thirty-one plates of a hieroglyphic
register of the tributaries of Montezuma,&mdash;the
same later reproduced in better style by Kingsborough.
Lorenzana was born in 1722, and
rising through the gradations of his Church, and
earning a good name as Bishop of Puebla, was
made Archbishop of Toledo shortly after he had
published the book now under consideration.
Pius VI. made him a cardinal in 1789, and he
died in Rome in 1804. Icazbalceta was not able
to ascertain whether the Bishop had before him
the original editions of the letters or Barcia’s reprint;
but he added to the value of his text by
numerous annotations. In 1828 an imperfect
reprint of this book, “á la ortografía moderna,”
was produced in New York for the Mexican
market, by Manuel del Mar, under the title of

<p><i>Cartas y relaciones al Emperador Carlos V.,

Paris, 1866. Besides the Cortés letters, this distinguished
scholar included in this book various
other contemporary documents relating to
the Conquest, embracing letters sent to Cortés’
lieutenants; and he also added an important
introduction. He included the fifth letter for
the first time in the series, and drew upon
the archives of Vienna and Simancas with advantage.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p><i>In French.</i> Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.,
Additions</i>, no. 73) notes a French rendering of a
text, seemingly made up of the first and second
letters, and probably following a Spanish original,
now lost, which was printed at Antwerp in
1523.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> This second letter is also epitomized in
the French <i>Extraict ou recueil des isles nouvellement
trouvées</i> of Peter Martyr, printed at Paris
in 1532, and in Bellegarde’s <i>Histoire universelle
des voyages</i> (Amsterdam, 1708), vol. i.</p>

<p>The principal French translation is one based
on Lorenzana, abridging that edition somewhat,
and numbering the letters erroneously first, second,
and third. It was published at Paris in
1778, 1779, etc., under the title <i>Correspondance de
Fernand Cortes avec l’Empereur Charles Quint</i>,
and was translated by the Vicomte de Flavigny.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a>
The text of Flavigny’s second letter is included
in Charton’s <i>Voyageurs</i>, iii. 368-420. There
were also editions of Flavigny printed in
Switzerland and at Frankfort.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>In German.</i> A translation of the second
and third letters, made by Andrew Diether and
Birck, was published at Augsburg in 1550 as
<i>Cortesi von dem Newen Hispanien</i>. After the
second letter, which constitutes part i., the beginning
of part ii. is borrowed from Peter Martyr,
which is followed by the third letter of Cortés;
and this is succeeded in turn, on folios 51-60, by
letters from Venezuela about the settlements
there (1534-1540), and one from Oviedo written
at San Domingo in 1543. There are matters
which are not contained in any of the Spanish
or Latin editions.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a></p>

<p>The second, third, and fourth letters&mdash;translated
by J. J. Stapfer, who supplied a meritorious
introduction and an appendix&mdash;were printed
at Heidelberg in 1779 as <i>Eroberung von Mexico</i>,
and again at Berne in 1793.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> Another German
version, by Karl Wilhelm Koppe,&mdash;<i>Drei

an introduction and notes, was published
at Berlin in 1834. It has the tribute-registers and

in Antwerp in 1523 (with a French counterpart
at the same time), and which seems to have been
based on the first and second letters, combined
in a Spanish original not now known. There is
a copy in the National Library at Paris. There
was a Dutch version, or epitome, in the Dutch
edition of Grynæus, 1563, and a Flemish version
appeared in Ablyn’s <i>Nieuwe Weerelt</i>, at
Antwerp, 1563. There was another Dutch rendering

<p>This letter was accompanied by reports to

<p>A secret letter (dated October 15) of Cortés
to the Emperor,&mdash;<i>Esta es una carta que
Hernando Cortés escrivio al Emperador</i>,&mdash;sent
with this fourth letter, is at Simancas. It was
printed by Icazbalceta in 1855 (Mexico, sixty
copies),<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> who reprinted it in his <i>Coleccion</i>, i. 470.
Gayangos, in 1866, printed it in his edition
(p. 325) from a copy which Muñoz had made.
Icazbalceta again printed it sumptuously, “en
caracteres góticos del siglo XVI.,” at Mexico in
1865 (seventy copies).<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> This letter also appears
in collections mentioned under the second letter.
It was in this letter that Cortés explained to the
Emperor his purpose of finding the supposed strait
which led from the Atlantic to the south sea.</p>

<p class="p2">V. <i>The fifth letter, dated Sept. 3, 1526.</i> It
pertains to the famous expedition to Honduras.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>
It is called <i>Carta quinta de relacion</i>, and was discovered
through Robertson’s instrumentality,
but not printed at length till it appeared in the
<i>Coleccion de documentos inéditos</i> (<i>España</i>), iv.
8-167, with other “relaciones” on this expedition.
George Folsom reprinted it in New
York in 1848 as “carta sexta ... publicada
ahora por primera vez” by mistake for “carta
quinta.”<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> It was translated and annotated by
Gayangos for the Hakluyt Society in 1868.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> Gayangos
had already included it in his edition of
the <i>Cartas</i>, 1866, and it had also been printed
by Vedia in Ribadeneyras’ <i>Biblioteca de autores
Españoles</i> (1852), vol. xxii., and later in the <i>Biblioteca
histórica de la Iberia</i> (1870). Extracts in
English are given in the appendix of Prescott’s
<i>Mexico</i>, vol. iii. Mr. Kirk, the editor of Prescott,
doubts if the copy in the Imperial Library
at Vienna is the original, because it has no date.
A copy at Madrid, purporting to be made from
the original by Alonzo Diaz, is dated Sept. 3,
1526,<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> and is preferred by Gayangos, who collated
its text with that of the Vienna Library.
Various other less important letters of Cortés
have been printed from time to time.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In estimating the letters of Cortés as historical
material, the soldierly qualities of them
impressed Prescott, and Helps is struck with
their directness so strongly that he is not willing
to believe in the prevarications or deceits of any
part of them. H. H. Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> on the contrary,
discovers in them “calculated misstatements,
both direct and negative.” It is well known
that Bernal Diaz and Pedro de Alvarado made
complaints of their leader’s too great willingness
to ignore all others but himself.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Three Contemporary Writers,&mdash;Gomara,
Bernal Diaz, and Sahagun.</span>&mdash;Fortunately
we have various other narratives to qualify
or confirm the recitals of the leader.</p>

<p>In 1540, when he was thirty years old, Francisco
Lopez Gomara became the chaplain and
secretary of Cortés. In undertaking an historical
record in which his patron played a leading
part, he might be suspected to write somewhat
as an adulator; and so Las Casas, Diaz,
and many others have claimed that he did, and
Muñoz asserts that Gomara believed his authorities
too easily.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> That the Spanish Government
made a show of suppressing his book soon after
it was published, and kept the edict in their
records till 1729, is rather in favor of his honest
chronicling. Gomara had good claims for consideration
in a learned training, a literary taste,
and in the possession of facilities which his
relations with Cortés threw in his way; and we
find him indispensable, if for no other reason,
because he had access to documentary evidence
which has since disappeared. His questionable
reputation for bias has not prevented Herrera
and other later historians placing great dependence
on him, and a native writer of the beginning
of the seventeenth century, Chimalpain,
has translated Gomara, adding some illustrations
for the Indian records.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a></p>

<p>Gomara’s book is in effect two distinct ones,
though called at first two parts of a <i>Historia general
de las Indias</i>. Of these the second part&mdash;<i>La
conquista de México</i>&mdash;appeared earliest, at
Saragossa in 1552, and is given to the Conquest
of Mexico, while the first part, more particularly
relating to the subjugation of Peru, appeared in
1553.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> What usually passes for a second edition
appeared at Medina del Campo, also in
1553;<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> and it was again reprinted at Saragossa
in 1554, this time as two distinct works,&mdash;one,
<i>Cronica de la Nueva España con la conquista de
México</i>; and the other, <i>La historia general de las
Indias y Nuevo Mundo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> The same year (1554)
saw several editions in Spanish at Antwerp, with
different publishers.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> An Italian edition followed
in 1555-1556, for one titlepage, <i>Historia
del ... capitano Don Ferdinando Cortés</i>, is dated
1556, and a second, <i>Historia de México</i>, has
1555,&mdash;both at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a></p>

<p>Other editions, more or
less complete, are noted as published in Venice
in 1560, 1564, 1565, 1566, 1570, 1573, 1576, and
1599.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> The earliest French edition appeared
at Paris in 1568 and 1569, for the two dates and
two imprints seem to belong to one issue; and
its text&mdash;a not very creditable translation by
Fumée&mdash;was reproduced in the editions of 1577,
1578, 1580, and with some additions in 1584, 1587,
1588, and 1597.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> The earliest edition in English
omits much. It is called <i>The Pleasant Historie
of the Conquest of the Weast India, now called
New Spayne, atchieved by the worthy Prince Hernando
Cortes, Marques of the valley of Huaxacac,
most delectable to reade, translated out of the Spanishe
tongue by T[homas] N[icholas]</i>, published by
Henry Bynneman in 1578.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> Gomara himself
warned his readers against undertaking a Latin
version, as he had one in hand himself; but it
was never printed.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Gomara had, no doubt, obscured the merits
of the captains of Cortés in telling the story of
that leader’s career. Instigated largely by this,
and confirmed in his purpose, one of the partakers
in the glories and hardships of the Conquest
was impelled to tell the story anew, in the
light of the observation which fell to a subordinate.
He was not perhaps so much jealous of
the fame of Cortés as he was hurt at the neglect
by Gomara of those whose support had made
the fame of Cortés possible.</p>

<p>This was Bernal
Diaz del Castillo, and his book is known as the
<i>Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Neuva
España</i>, which was not printed till 1632 at
Madrid, nor had it been written till half a century
after the Conquest, during which interval the
name of Cortés had gathered its historic prestige.
Diaz had begun the writing of it in 1568 at
Santiago in Guatemala, when, as he tells us,
only five of the original companions of Cortés
remained alive.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> It is rudely, or rather simply,
written, as one might expect. The author has
none of the practised arts of condensation; and
Prescott<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> well defines the story as long-winded
and gossiping, but of great importance. It is
indeed inestimable, as the record of the actor in
more than a hundred of the fights which marked
the progress of the Conquest. The untutored air
of the recital impressed Robertson and Southey
with confidence in its statements, and the reader
does not fail to be conscious of a minute rendering
of the life which made up those eventful
days. His criticism of Cortés himself does not,
by any means, prevent his giving him great
praise; and, as Prescott says,<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> he censures his
leader, but he does not allow any one else to do
the same. The lapse of time before Diaz set
about his literary task did not seem to abate his
zeal or check his memory; but it does not fail,
however, to diminish our own confidence a good
deal. Prescott<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> contends that the better the
acquaintance with Diaz’ narrative, the less is the
trust which one is inclined to put in it.<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> The
Spanish text which we possess is taken, it is
said, directly from the original manuscript, which
had slumbered in private hands till Father
Alonso Rémon found it, or a copy of it, in Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and obtained a decree to print it,<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> about fifty
years after Diaz’ death, which occurred in 1593,
or thereabouts.</p>

<p class="p2">The nearest approach among contemporaries
to a survey of the story of the Conquest from the
Aztec side is that given by the Franciscan,
Sahagun, in connection with his great work on
the condition of the Mexican peoples prior to
the coming of the Spaniards. Sahagun came to
Mexico in 1529. He lived in the new land for
over sixty years, and acquired a proficiency in
the native tongue hardly surpassed by any other
of the Spaniards. He brought to the new field
something besides the iconoclastic frenzy that
led so many of his countrymen to destroy what
they could of the literature and arts of the Aztecs,&mdash;so
necessary in illustration of their pagan life
and rites. This zealous and pious monk turned
aside from seeking the preferments of his class
to study the motives, lives, and thoughts of the
Aztec peoples. He got from them their hieroglyphics;
these in turn were translated into the
language of their speech, but expressed in the
Roman character; and the whole subjected more
than once to the revising of such of the natives
as had, in his day, been educated in the Spanish
schools.<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> Thirty years were given to this kind
of preparation; and when he had got his work
written out in Mexican, the General of his Order
seized it, and some years elapsed before a restitution
of it was made. Sahagun had got to be
eighty years old when, with his manuscript
restored to him, he set about re-writing it, with
the Mexican text in one column and the Spanish
in another. The two huge volumes of his script
found their way to Spain, and were lost sight of
till Muñoz discovered them in the convent of
Tolosa in Navarre, not wholly unimpaired by
the vicissitudes to which they had been subjected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
The Nahuatl text, which made part of it, is still
missing.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a></p>

<p>It was not long afterward (1829-1830) printed
by Cárlos María Bustamante in three volumes
as <i>Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>
to which was added, as a fourth volume, also published
separately, <i>Historia de la conquista de
México</i>, containing what is usually cited as the
twelfth book of Sahagun. In this, as in the other
parts, he used a copy which Muñoz had made,
and which is the earlier draft of the text as
Sahagun formed it. It begins with a recital of
the omens which preceded the coming of Grijalva,
and ends with the fall of the city; and it is
written, as he says, from the evidence, in large
part, of the eye-witnesses, particularly on the
Aztec side, though mixed, somewhat confusedly,
with recollections from old Spanish soldiers.
Harrisse<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> speaks of this edition as “castrated
in such a way as to require, for a perfect understanding
of this dry but important book, the
reading of the parts published in vols. v. and
vi. of Kingsborough.” The text, as given in
Kingsborough’s <i>Mexico</i>, began to appear about
a year later, that edition only giving, in the first
instance, book vi., which relates to the customs
of the Aztecs before the Conquest; but in a later
volume he reproduced the whole of the work
without comment. Kingsborough had also used
the Muñoz text, and has made, according to Simeon,
fewer errors in transcribing the Nahuatl
words than Bustamante, and has also given a
purer Spanish text. Bustamante again printed,
in 1840, another text of this twelfth book, after a
manuscript belonging to the Conde de Cortina,
appending notes by Clavigero and others, with
an additional chapter.<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> The Mexican editor
claimed that this was the earlier text; but Prescott
denies it. Torquemada is thought to have
used, but without due acknowledgment,
still another
text, which is less modified
than the others in expressions
regarding the Conquerors.
The peculiar value of
Sahagun’s narrative hardly
lies in its completeness, proportions,
or even trustworthiness
as an historical record.
“His accuracy as regards any
historical fact is not to be
relied on,” says Helps.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> Brevoort
calls the work of interest
mainly for its records of
persons and places not found elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> Prescott
thinks that this twelfth book is the most
honest record which the natives have left us, as
Sahagun embodies the stories and views prevalent
among the descendants of the victims of the
Conquest. “This portion of the work,” he says,
“was rewritten by Sahagun at a later period of
his life, and considerable changes were made in
it; yet it may be doubted if the reformed version
reflects the traditions of the country as faithfully
as the original draft.”<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> This new draft
was made by Sahagun in 1585, thirty years after
the original writing, for the purpose, as he says,
of adding some things which had been omitted,
and leaving out others. Prescott could not find,
in comparing this later draft with the earlier,
that its author had mitigated any of the statements
which, as he first wrote them, bore so
hard on his countrymen. The same historian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
thinks there is but little difference in the intrinsic
value of the two drafts.<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a></p>

<p>The best annotated edition of Sahagun is a
French translation, published in Paris in 1880 as
<i>Histoire générale des choses de la Nouvelle Espagne</i>,
seemingly from the Kingsborough text, which is
more friendly to the Spaniards than the first of
Bustamante. The joint editors are Denis Jourdanet
and Remi Siméon, the latter, as a Nahuatl
scholar, taking charge of those portions of the
text which fell within his linguistic range, and
each affording a valuable introduction in their
respective studies.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b>C.</b> <span class="smcap">Other Early Accounts.</span>&mdash;The <i>Voyages,
Relations, et Mémoires</i> of Ternaux-Compans
(Paris, 1837-1840) offer the readiest source of
some of the most significant of the documents
and monographs pertaining to early Mexican
history. Two of the volumes<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> gather some of
the minor documents. Another volume<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> is
given to Zurita’s “Rapport sur les différentes
classes des chefs de la Nouvelle Espagne.”
Three others<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> contain an account of the cruelties
practised by the Spaniards at the Conquest,
and the history of the ancient kings of Tezcuco,&mdash;both
the work of Ferdinando d’Alva Ixtlilxochitl.<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>
The former work, not correctly printed,
and called, somewhat arbitrarily, <i>Horribles crueldades
de los Conquistadores de México</i>, was first
published by Bustamante, in 1829, as a supplement
to Sahagun. The manuscript (which was
no. 13 of a number of <i>Noticias</i>, or <i>Relaciones históricas</i>,
by this native writer) had been for a
while after the writer’s death (about 1648) preserved
in the library of the Jesuit College in
Mexico, and had thence passed to the archive general
of the State. It bears the certificate of
a notary, in 1608, that it had been compared
with the Aztec records and found to be correct.
The original work contained several <i>Relaciones</i>,
but only the one (no. 13) relating to the Conquest
was published by Bustamante and Ternaux.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p>The other work of Ixtlilxochitl was first
printed (after Veytia’s copy) in Spanish by
Kingsborough, in his ninth volume, before Ternaux,
who used another copy, included it in his
collection under the title of <i>Histoire des Chichimeque
ou des anciens Rois de Tezcuco</i>. This is
the only work of Ixtlilxochitl which has been
printed entire. According to Clavigero, these
treatises were written at the instance of the
Spanish viceroy; and as a descendant of the
royal line of Tezcuco (the great great-grandson,
it is said, of the king of like name) their author
had great advantages, with perhaps great predispositions
to laudation, though he is credited
with extreme carefulness in his statements;<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> and
Prescott affirms that he has been followed with
confidence by such as have had access to his
writings. Ixtlilxochitl informs us that he has
derived his material from such remains of his ancestral
documents as were left to him. He seems
also to have used Gomara and other accessible
authorities. He lived in the early part of the
seventeenth century, and as interpreter of the
viceroy maintained a respectable social position
when many of his royal line were in the humblest
service. His <i>Relaciones</i> are hardly regular
historical compositions, since they lack independent
and compact form; but his <i>Historia
Chichimeca</i> is the best of them, and is more depended
upon by Prescott than the others are.
There is a certain charm in his simplicity, his
picturesqueness, and honesty; and readers accept
these qualities often in full recompense for
his credulity and want of discrimination,&mdash;and
perhaps for a certain servility to the Spanish masters,
for whose bounty he could press the claims
of a line of vassals of his own blood.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a></p>

de Bourbourg, in the introduction to his <i>Nations
civilisées du Mexique</i> (Paris, 1857-1859), enumerates
the manuscript sources to which he had
access,<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> largely pertaining to the period anterior
to the Spaniards, but also in part covering the
history of the Conquest, which in his fourth volume<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>
he narrates mainly from the native point
of view, while he illustrates the Indian life under
its contact with the Spanish rule.</p>

<p>Brasseur was fortunate in having access to
the Aubin Collection of manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> which had
originally been formed between 1736 and 1745
by the Chevalier Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci;
and that collector in 1746 gave a catalogue of
them at the end of his <i>Idea de una nueva historia
general de la America septentrional</i>, published at
Madrid in that year.<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> Unfortunately, the labors
of this devoted archæologist incurred the jealousy
of the Spanish Government, and his library
was more or less scattered; but to him we owe
a large part of what we find in the collections of
Bustamante, Kingsborough, and Ternaux. Mariano
Veytia<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> was his executor, and had the advantages
of Boturini’s collections in his own

however, shows us that much has disappeared,
which we may regret. Such is the
<i>Cronica</i> of Tlaxcala, by Juan Ventura Zapata
y Mendoza, which brought the story down to
1689, which Brinton hopes may yet be discovered
in Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> One important work is saved,&mdash;that
of Camargo.</p>

<p>Muñoz Camargo was born in Mexico just
after the Conquest, and was connected by marriage
with leading native families, and attained
high official position in Tlaxcala, whose history
he wrote, beginning its composition in 1576, and
finishing it in 1585. He had collected much
material. Ternaux<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> printed a French translation
of a mutilated text; but it has never been
printed in the condition, fragmentary though it
be, in which it was recovered by Boturini. Prescott
says the original manuscript was long
preserved in a convent in Mexico, where Torquemada
used it. It was later taken to Spain,
when it found its way into the Muñoz Collection
in the Academy of History at Madrid, whence
Prescott got his copy. This last historian
speaks of the work as supplying much curious
and authentic information respecting the social
and religious condition of the Aztecs. Camargo
tells fully the story of the Conquest, but he deals
out his applause and sympathy to the conquerors
and the conquered with equal readiness.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a></p>

<p>Other manuscripts have not yet been edited.
Chimalpain’s <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, in the Nahuatl
tongue, which covers the interval from <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>
1068 to 1597, is one of these. Another Nahuatl
manuscript in Boturini’s list is an anonymous
history of Culhuacan and Mexico. An imperfect
translation of this into Spanish, by Galicia,
has been made in Mexico. Brasseur copied it,
and called it the <i>Codex Chimalpopoca</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> In 1879
the Museo Nacional at Mexico began to print it
in their <i>Anales</i> (vol. ii.), adding a new version
by Mendoza and Solis, under the title of <i>Anales
de Cuauhtitlan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a></p>

<p>Bancroft’s list, prefixed to his <i>Mexico</i>, makes
mention of most of these native Mexican
sources. Of principal use among them may be
mentioned Fernando de Alvaro Tezozomoc’s
<i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, or <i>Histoire du Mexique</i>, written
in 1598, and published in 1853, in Paris, by
Ternaux-Compans.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>Brinton has published in the first volume of
his library of <i>Aboriginal American Literature</i>
(1882, p. 189) the chronicle of Chac-xulub-chen,
written in the Maya in 1562, which throws light
on the methods of the Spanish Conquest.</p>

<p>There was a native account, by Don Gabriel
Castañeda, of the conquest of the Chichimecs
by the Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza in 1541;
but Brinton<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> says all trace of it is lost since it
was reported to be in the Convent of Ildefonso
in Mexico.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important native contribution
to the history of Guatemala is Francisco
Ernandez Arana Xahila’s <i>Memorial de Tecpan
Atitlan</i>, written in 1581 and later in the dialect
of Cakchiquel, and bringing the history of a
distinguished branch of the Cakchiquels down
to 1562, from which point it is continued by
Francisco Gebuta Queh. Brasseur de Bourbourg
loosely rendered it, and from this paraphrase
a Spanish version has been printed in
Guatemala; but the original has never been
printed. Brinton (in his <i>Aboriginal American
Authors</i>, p. 32) says he has a copy; and another
is in Europe. It is of great importance as giving
the native accounts of the conquest of Guatemala.<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>
An ardent advocacy of the natives was
also shown in the <i>Historia de las Indias de Nueva
España</i> of the Padre Diego Duran, which was
edited by Ramirez, so far as the first volume goes,
in 1867, when it was published in Mexico with
an atlas of plates after the manuscript; but this
publication is said not to present all the drawings
of the original manuscript. The overthrow
of Maximilian prevented the completion of the
publication. The incoming Republican government
seized what had been printed, so that the
fruit of Ramirez’s labor is now scarce. Quaritch
priced the editor’s own copy at £8 10<i>s.</i> The
editor had polished the style of the original somewhat,
and made other changes, which excited
some disgust in the purists; and this action on
his part may have had something to do with the
proceedings of the new Government. Ramirez
claimed descent from the Aztecs, and this may
account for much of his stern judgment respecting
Cortés.<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> The story in this first volume is only
brought down to the reign of Montezuma. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
manuscript is preserved in the royal library at
Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> Duran was a half-breed, his mother
being of Tezcuco. He became a Dominican;
but a slender constitution kept him from the missionary
field, and he passed a monastic life of
literary labors. He had finished in 1579 the
later parts of his work treating of the Mexican
divinities, calendars, and festivals; and then,
reverting to the portions which came first in the
manuscript, he tells the story of Mexican history
rather clumsily, but with a certain native force
and insight, down to the period of the Honduras
expedition. The manuscript of Duran passed,
after his death in 1588, to Juan Tovar, and from
him, perhaps with the representations that Tovar
(or Tobar) was its author, to José de Acosta,
who represents Tovar as the author, and who
had then prepared, while in Peru, his <i>De Natura
Novi Orbis</i>.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>E.</b> <span class="smcap">The Earlier Historians.</span>&mdash;José de
Acosta was born about 1540 in Spain; but at
fourteen he joined the Jesuits. He grew learned,
and in 1571 he went to Peru, in which country he
spent fifteen years, becoming the provincial of his
Order. He tarried two other years in Mexico&mdash;where
he saw Tovar&mdash;and in the islands. He
then returned to Spain laden with manuscripts
and information, became a royal favorite, held
other offices, and died as rector of Salamanca
in 1600,<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> having published in his books on the
New World the most popular and perhaps
most satisfactory account of it up to that time;
while his theological works give evidence, as
Markham says, of great learning.</p>

<p>Acosta’s first publication appeared at Salamanca
in 1588 and 1589, and was in effect two
essays, though they are usually found under one
cover (they had separate titles, but were continuously
paged), <i>De natura Novi Orbis libri duo, et de
promulgatione evangelii apud barbaros, ... libri
sex</i>. In the former he describes the physical
features of the country, and in the latter he told
the story Of the conversion of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>
Acosta now translated the two books of the
<i>De natura</i> into Spanish, and added five other
books. The work was thus made to form a
general cosmographical treatise, with particular
reference to the New World; and included an
account of the religion and government of the
Indians of Peru and Mexico. He also gave
a brief recital of the Conquest. In this extended
form, and under the title of <i>Historia natvral
y moral de las Indias, en qve se tratan las cosas
notables del cielo, y elementos, metales, plantas,
y animales dellas; y los ritos, y ceremonias, leyes,
y gouierno, y guerras de los Indios</i>, it was published
at Seville in 1590.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>

<p>Two other accounts of this period deserve
notice. One is by Joan Suarez de Peralta, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
was born in Mexico in 1536, and wrote a <i>Tratado
del descubrimiento de las Yndias y su conquista</i>,
which is preserved in manuscript in the library
at Toledo in Spain. It is not full, however, on
the Conquest; but is more definite for the period
from 1565 to 1589. It was printed at Madrid
in 1878, in the <i>Noticias históricas de la Nueva
España publicadas con la protection del ministerio
de fomento por Don Justo Zaragoza</i>. The other
is Henrico Martinez’ <i>Repertorio de los Tiempos
y historia natural de la Nueva España</i>, published
at Mexico in 1606. It covers the Mexican
annals from 1520 to 1590.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a></p>

<p>One of the earliest to depend largely on the
native chroniclers was Juan de Torquemada, in
his <i>Monarquía Indiana</i>. This author was born
in Spain, but came young to Mexico; and was
a priest of the Franciscan habit, who finally
became (1614-1617) the provincial of that Order.
He had assiduously labored to collect all that
he could find regarding the history of the people
among whom he was thrown; and his efforts
were increased when, in 1609, he received
orders to prepare his labors for publication.
His book is esteemed for the help it affords
in understanding these people. Ternaux calls
it the most complete narrative which we possess
of the ancient history of Mexico. He took the
history, as the native writers had instructed him,
of the period before the Conquest, and derived
from them and his own observation much respecting
the kind of life which the conquerors
found prevailing in the country. In his account
of the Conquest, which constitutes the fourth
book in vol. i., Torquemada seems to depend
largely on Herrera, though he does not neglect
Sahagun and the native writers. Clavigero
tells us that Torquemada for fifty years had
known the language of the natives, and spent
twenty years or more in arranging his history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
He also tells us of the use which Torquemada
made of the manuscripts which he found in the
colleges of Mexico, of the writings of Ixtlilxochitl,
Camargo, and of the history of Cholula by another
writer of native origin, Juan Batista Pomar.
Another book of considerable use to him was the
work of a warm eulogist of the natives, if not
himself of their blood; and this was the <i>Historia
Eclesiástica Indiana</i>, a work written by Gerónimo
de Mendieta near the end of the sixteenth
century. Mendieta was in Mexico from 1554
to 1571,<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> and his work, finished in 1596, after
having remained for two hundred years in
manuscript, was printed and annotated by
Icazbalceta at Mexico, in 1870.<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Monarquía Indiana</i>, in which these and
other writers were so freely employed as to be
engrafted in parts almost bodily, was first
printed in three volumes at Madrid in 1615;
but before this the Inquisition had struck out
from its pages some curious chapters, particularly,
says Rich, one comparing the migration
of the Toltecs to that of the Israelites. The
colophon of this edition shows the date of 1614.<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>
It is said that most of it was lost in a shipwreck,
and this accounts, doubtless, for its rarity. The
original manuscript, however, being preserved,
it served Barcia well in editing a reprint in 1723,
published at Madrid, which is now considered
the standard edition.<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> Torquemada doubtless
derived something of his skill in the native
tongue from his master, Fray Joan Baptista,
who had the reputation of being the most
learned scholar of the Mexican language in his
time.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Teatro Mexicano</i> of Augustin de Vetancurt,
published at Mexico in 1697-1698,<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> is the
next general chronicle after Torquemada. Vetancourt,
also, was a Franciscan, born in Mexico in
1620, and died in 1700. He had the literary
fecundity of his class; but the most important
of his works is the one already named; and
in the third part of the first volume we find his
history of the Conquest. He seldom goes behind
his predecessor, and Torquemada must
stand sponsor for much of his recital.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>F.</b> <span class="smcap">Modern Historians.</span>&mdash;The well-known
work of Solis (<i>Historia de la Conquista de México</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>
published at Madrid in 1684) is the conspicuous
precursor of a long series of histories of the
Conquest, written without personal knowledge
of the actors in this extraordinary event. Solis
ended his narrative with the fall of the city,
the author’s death preventing any further progress,
though it is said he had gathered further
materials; but they are not known to exist. A
work by Ignacio Salazar y Olarte, continuing
the narrative down to the death of Cortés, is
called a second part, and was published at
Cordova in 1743, under the title of <i>Historia de
la conquista de México, poblacion y progressos de
la América septentrional conocida por el nombre
de Nueva España</i>. This continuation was reprinted
at Madrid in 1786, and in the opinion
of Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> abounds “in all the faults of the
superficial and florid composition of Solis.”</p>

<p>Solis, who was born at Alcala in 1610, was
educated at Salamanca, and had acquired a
great reputation in letters, when he attracted
the attention of the Court, and was appointed
historiographer of the Indies. Some time afterward
(1667) he entered the Church, at fifty-six;
but to earn his salary as official chronicler,&mdash;which
was small enough at best,&mdash;he turned,
with a good deal of the poetic and artistic instinct
which his previous training had developed, to
tell the story of the Conquest, with a skill which
no one before had employed upon the theme.
The result was a work which, “to an extraordinary
degree,” as Ticknor<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> says, took on “the
air of an historical epic, so exactly are all its
parts and episodes modelled into a harmonious
whole, whose catastrophe is the fall of the great
Mexican Empire.” The book was a striking
contrast to the chronicling spirit of all preceding recitals.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The world soon saw&mdash;though the
sale of the book was not large at once, and the
author died very poor two years later (1686)&mdash;that
the strange story had been given its
highest setting. Solis gives no notes; and one
needs to know the literature of the subject, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
track him to his authorities. If this is done,
however, it appears that his investigation was
far from deep, and that with original material
within his reach he rarely or never used it,
but took the record at second hand. Robertson,
who had to depend on him more or less,
was aware of this, and judged him less solicitous
of discovering truth than of glorifying
the splendor of deeds. This panegyrical strain
in the book has lowered its reputation, particularly
among foreign critics, who fail to share the
enthusiasm which Solis expresses for Cortés.
We may call his bitter denunciations of the
natives bigotry or pious zeal; but Ticknor
accounts for it by saying that Solis “refused to
see the fierce and marvellous contest except
from the steps of the altar where he had been
consecrated.” The religion and national pride
of the Spaniards have not made this quality
detract in the least from the estimation in which
the book has long been held; but all that they
say of the charm and purity of its style, despite
something of tiresomeness in its even flow, is
shared by the most conspicuous of foreign
critics, like Prescott and Ticknor. Rich, who
had opportunities for knowing, bears evidence
to the estimation in Spain of those qualities
which have insured the fame of Solis.<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a></p>

<p>The story was not told again with the dignity
of a classic,&mdash;except so far as Herrera composed
it,&mdash;till Robertson, in his <i>History of America</i>, recounted
it. He used the printed sources with
great fidelity; but he was denied a chance to
examine the rich manuscript material which was
open to Solis, and which Robertson would
doubtless have used more abundantly. In a
Note (xcvii.) he enumerates his chief authorities,
and they are only the letters of Cortés and the
story as told by Gomara, Bernal Diaz, Peter
Martyr, Solis, and Herrera.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> Of Solis, Robertson
says he knows no author in any language
whose literary fame has risen so far beyond his
real merits. He calls him “destitute of that
patient industry in research which conducts to
the knowledge of truth, and a stranger to that
impartiality which weighs evidence with cool
attention.... Though he sometimes quotes
the despatches of Cortés, he seems not to have
consulted them; and though he sets out with
some censure on Gomara, he frequently prefers
his authority&mdash;the most doubtful of any&mdash;to that
of the other contemporary historians.” Robertson
judged that Herrera furnished the fullest
and most accurate information, and that if his
work had not in its chronological order been so
perplexed, disconnected, and obscure, Herrera
might justly have been ranked among the most
eminent historians of his country. William
Smyth, in the twenty-first section of his <i>Lectures
on Modern History</i>, in an account which is there
given of the main sources of information respecting
the Conquest, as they were accessible
forty or fifty years ago, awards high praise&mdash;certainly
not undeserved for his time&mdash;to
Robertson. Southey accused Robertson of unduly
depreciating the character and civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of the Mexicans; and others have held the opinion
that he had a tendency to palliate the crimes
of the invaders. Robertson, in his later editions,
replied to such strictures, and held
that Clavigero and others had differed from
him chiefly in confiding in the improbable narratives
and fanciful conjectures of Torquemada
and Boturini.</p>

<p>Francisco Saverio Clavigero was a Jesuit, who
had long resided in Mexico, being born at Vera
Cruz in 1731; but when expelled with his Order,
he took up his abode in Italy in 1767. He had
the facilities and the occasion for going more
into detail than Robertson. His <i>Storia antica
del Messico cavata da’ migliori storici spagnuoli, e
da’ manoscritti; e dalle pitture antiche degl’Indiani:

e di varie figure: e dissertazioni sulla

was published in four volumes at Cesena in
1780-1781. He gives the names of thirty-nine
Indian and Spanish writers who had written
upon the theme, and has something to say of
the Mexican historical paintings which he had
examined. H. H. Bancroft esteems him a leading
authority,<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> and says he rearranged the material
in a masterly manner, and invested it with
a philosophic spirit, altogether superior to anything
presented till Prescott’s time.<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> It is in
his third volume that Clavigero particularly
treats of the Conquest, having been employed
on the earlier chronicles and the manners and
customs of the people in the first and second,
while the fourth volume is made up of particular
dissertations. Clavigero was not without
learning. He had passed three years at the
Jesuit College at Tepozotlan, and had taught
as a master in various branches. At Bologna,
where he latterly lived, he founded an academy;
and here he died in 1787, leaving behind
him a <i>Storia della California</i>, published
at Venice in 1789.<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a></p>

<p>Fifteen years ago it was the opinion of
Henry Stevens,<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> that all other books which have
been elaborated since on the same subject, instead
of superseding Clavigero’s, have tended
rather to magnify its importance.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a></p>

<p>The most conspicuous treatment of the subject,
in the minds of the elders of the present
generation, is doubtless that of Prescott, who
published his <i>Conquest of Mexico</i> in 1843, dividing
it into three distinct parts,&mdash;the first showing
a survey of the Aztec civilization; the second
depicting the Conquest; while the final period
brought down the life of Cortés to his death.
Charton<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> speaks of Solis as a work “auquel
le livre de Prescott a porté un dernier coup.”
Prescott was at great expense and care in
amassing much manuscript material never before
used, chiefly in copies, which Rich and
others had procured for him, and he is somewhat
minute in his citations from them. They
have since been in large part printed, and
doubtless very much more is at present accessible
in type to the student than was in Prescott’s
day.<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a></p>

<p>Prescott was of good New England stock,
settled in Essex County, Massachusetts, where
(in Salem) he was born in 1796. His father
removed to Boston in 1808, and became a judge
of one of the courts. A mischance at Harvard,
in a student’s frolic, deprived young Prescott of
the use of one eye; and the other became in time
permanently affected. Thus he subsequently
labored at his historical studies under great
disadvantage,<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> and only under favorable circumstances
and for short periods could he read
for himself. In this way he became dependent
upon the assistance of secretaries, though he
generally wrote his early drafts by the aid of a
noctograph.</p>

<p>From 1826 to 1837 he was engaged
on his <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, and this naturally
led him to the study of his Mexican and Peruvian
themes; and Irving, who had embarked on
them as a literary field, generously abandoned
his pursuit to the new and rising historian.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> The

long remained a charming book, as fruitful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
authority as the material then accessible could
make it.</p>

<p>In the Preface to his <i>Mexico</i> Mr. Prescott
tells of his success in getting unpublished material,
showing how a more courteous indulgence
was shown to him than Robertson had enjoyed.
By favor of the Academy of History in Madrid
he got many copies of the manuscripts
of Muñoz and of Vargas y Ponçe, and he enjoyed
the kind offices of Navarrete in gathering
this material. He mentions that, touching the
kindred themes of Mexico and Peru, he thus obtained
the bulk of eight thousand folio pages.
From Mexico itself he gathered other appliances,
and these largely through the care of
Alaman, the minister of foreign affairs, and of
Calderon de la Barca, the minister to Mexico
from Spain. He also acknowledges the courtesy
of the descendants of Cortés in opening
their family archives; that of Sir Thomas
Phillipps, whose manuscript stores have become
so famous, and the kindness of Ternaux-Compans.</p>

<p>To Mr. John Foster Kirk, who had been
Prescott’s secretary, the preparation of new
editions of Prescott’s works was intrusted, and
in this series the <i>Mexico</i> was republished in
1874. Kirk was enabled, as Prescott himself
had been in preparing for it, to make use of
the notes which Ramirez had added to the
Spanish translation by Joaquin Navarro, published
in Mexico in 1844, and of those of Lúcas
Alaman, attached to another version, published
also in Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a></p>

<p>Almost coincident with the death of Prescott,
was published by a chance Mr. Robert Anderson
Wilson’s <i>New History of the Conquest of Mexico</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>
Its views were not unexpected, and indeed
Prescott had been in correspondence<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> with the
author. His book was rather an extravagant
argument than a history, and was aimed to
prove the utter untrustworthiness of the ordinary
chroniclers of the Conquest, charging the
conquerors with exaggerating and even creating
the fabric of the Aztec civilization, to enhance
the effect which the overthrow of so much
splendor would have in Europe. To this end
he pushes Cortés aside as engrafting fable on
truth for such a purpose, dismisses rather
wildly Bernal Diaz as a myth, and declares the
picture-writings to be Spanish fabrications.
This view was not new, except in its excess
of zeal. Albert Gallatin had held a similar
belief.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> Lewis Cass had already seriously
questioned, in the <i>North American Review</i>,
October, 1840, the consistency of the Spanish
historians. A previous work by Mr. Wilson
had already, indeed, announced his views, though
less emphatically. This book had appeared in
three successive editions,&mdash;as <i>Mexico and its
Religion</i> (New York, 1855); then as <i>Mexico, its
Peasants and its Priests</i> (1856); and finally as
<i>Mexico, Central America, and California</i>.</p>

<p>It was easy to accuse Wilson of ignorance
and want of candor,&mdash;for he had laid himself
open too clearly to this charge,&mdash;and Mr.
Prescott’s friend, Mr. George Ticknor, arraigned
him in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1859.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
He reminded Wilson that he ought to have
known that Don Enrique de Vedia, who had
published an edition of Bernal Diaz in 1853, had
cited Fuentes y Guzman, whose manuscript
history of Guatemala was before that editor, as
referring in it to the manuscript of Bernal Diaz
(his great-grandfather), which was then in existence,&mdash;a
verity and no myth. Further than
this, Brasseur de Bourbourg, who chanced then
to be in Boston, bore testimony that he had seen
and used the autograph manuscript of Bernal
Diaz in the archives of Guatemala.</p>

<p>In regard to the credibility of the accounts
which Prescott depends upon, his editor,<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> Mr.
Kirk, has not neglected to cite the language
of Mr. E. B. Tylor, in his <i>Anahuac</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> where he
says, respecting his own researches on the spot,
that what he saw of Mexico tended generally
to confirm Prescott’s History, and but seldom
to make his statements appear improbable.
The impeachment of the authorities, which
Wilson attacks, is to be successful, if at all, by
other processes than those he employs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Arthur Helps,<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> in tracing the
rise of negro slavery and the founding of
colonial government in Spanish America, had
published his <i>Conquerors of the New World and
their Bondsmen</i> (London, 1848-1852),&mdash;a somewhat
speculative essay, which, with enlargement
of purpose and more detail, resulted in 1855-1861
in the publication of his <i>Spanish Conquest
in America</i>, reprinted in New York in 1867.
He gives a glowing account of the Aztec civilization,
and, excerpting the chapters on the Conquest,
he added some new details of the private
life of Cortés, and published it separately in
1871 as an account of that leader, which is
attractive as a biography, if not comprehensive
as a history of the Conquest. “Every page
affords evidence of historic lore,” says Field,
“and almost every sentence glows with the
warmth of his philanthropy.”<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> Helps has
himself told the object and method of his book,
and it is a different sort of historical treatment
from all the others which we are passing in
review. “To bring before the reader, not conquest
only, but the results of conquest; the
mode of colonial government which ultimately
prevailed; the extirpation of native races, the
introduction of other races, the growth of slavery,
and the settlement of the <i>encomiendas</i> on
which all Indian society depended,&mdash;has been
the object of this history.”<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a></p>

<p>Among the later works not in English we
need not be detained long. The two most noteworthy
in French are the <i>Histoire des nations
civilisées du Mexique</i> of Brasseur de Bourbourg,
more especially mentioned on another page,
and Michel Chevalier’s <i>Mexique avant et pendant
la Conquête</i>, published at Paris in 1845.<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>
In German, Theodor Arnim’s <i>Das Alte Mexico
und die eroberung Neu Spaniens durch Cortes</i>,
Leipsic, 1865, is a reputable book.<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> In Spanish,
beside the <i>Vida de Cortés</i> given by Icazbalceta
in his <i>Coleccion</i>, vol. i. p. 309, there is the important
work of Lúcas Alaman, the <i>Disertaciones
sobre la Historia de la República Mejicana</i>, published
at Mexico in three volumes in 1844-1849,
which is a sort of introduction to his <i>Historia
de Méjico</i>, in five volumes, published in 1849-1852.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>
He added not a little in his appendixes
from the archives of Simancas, and the latter
book is considered the best of the histories in
Spanish. In 1862 Francisco Carbajal Espinosa’s
<i>Historia de México</i>, bringing the story
down from the earliest times, was begun in
Mexico. Bancroft calls it pretentious, and
mostly borrowed from Clavigero.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>Returning to the English tongue, in which
the story of Mexico has been so signally told
more than once from the time of Robertson,
we find still the amplest contribution in the
<i>History of Mexico</i>, a part of the extended series
of the <i>History of the Pacific States</i>, published
under the superintendence of Hubert H. Bancroft.
Of Bancroft and these books mention is
made in another place. The <i>Mexico</i> partakes
equally of the merits and demerits attaching to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
his books and their method. It places the
student under more obligations than any of
the histories of the Conquest which have gone
before, though one tires of the strained and
purely extraneous classical allusions,&mdash;which
seem to have been affected by his staff, or by
some one on it, during the progress of this
particular book of the series.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>G.</b> <span class="smcap">Yucatan.</span>&mdash;With the subsequent subjugation
of Yucatan Cortés had nothing to do.
Francisco de Montejo had been with Grijalva
when he landed at Cozumel on the Yucatan
coast, and with Cortés when he touched at the
same island on his way to Mexico. After the
fall of the Aztecs, Montejo was the envoy whom
Cortés sent to Spain, and while there the Emperor
commissioned him (Nov. 17, 1526) to conduct
a force for the settlement of the peninsula.
Early in 1527 Montejo left Spain with Alonso
de Avila as second in command. For twenty
years and more the conquest went on, with varying
success. At one time not a Spaniard was
left in the country. No revolts of the natives
occurred after 1547, when the conquest may be
considered as complete. The story is told with
sufficient fulness in Bancroft’s <i>Mexico</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> The
main sources of our information are the narrative
of Bernal Diaz, embodying the reports of
eye-witnesses, and the histories of Oviedo and
Herrera. Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> gives various incidental
references. The more special authorities, however,
are the <i>Historia de Yucathan</i> of Diego Lopez
Cogolludo, published at Madrid in 1688,<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> who
knew how to use miracles for his reader’s sake,
and who had the opportunity of consulting most
that had been written, and all that had been
printed up to his time. He closes his narrative
in 1665.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> The Bishop of Yucatan, Diego de
Landa, in his <i>Relation des choses de Yucatan</i>, as
the French translation terms it, has left us the
only contemporary Spanish document of the
period of the Conquest. The book is of more
interest in respect to the Maya civilization than
as to the progress of the Spanish domination.
It was not printed till it was edited by Brasseur
de Bourbourg, with an introduction, and
published in Paris in 1864.<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a></p>

<p>Landa was born in 1524, and was one of the
first of his Order to come to Yucatan, where
he finally became Bishop of Mérida in 1572,
and died in 1579. Among the books commonly
referred to for the later period is the first
part (the second was never published) of Juan
de Villagutierre Sotomayor’s <i>Historia de la Conquista
de la provincia de el Itza</i>, etc., Madrid,
1701. It deals somewhat more with the spiritual
and the military conquests, but writers find
it important.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p>The latest English history of the peninsula
is that by Charles St. J. Fancourt, <i>History of Yucatan</i>,
London, 1854;<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> but a more extended,
if less agreeable, book is Ancona’s <i>Historia de
Yucatan desde la época mas remota hasta nuestros
dias</i>, published at Mérida in four volumes in
1878-1880. It gives references which will be
found useful.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a></p>


<p class="p1"><b>H.</b> <span class="smcap">Bibliography of Mexico.</span>&mdash;The earliest
special bibliography of Mexico of any moment
is that which, under the title of <i>Catalogo de sa museo
historico Indiano</i>, is appended to Boturini Benaduci’s
<i>Idea de una nueva historia general de la
America septentrional</i> (Madrid, 1746), which was
the result of eight years’ investigations into the
history of Mexico. He includes a list of books,
maps, and manuscripts, of which the last remnants
in 1853 were in the Museo Nacional in Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>
Of the list of New Spain authors by Eguiara y
Eguren, only a small part was published in 1755
as <i>Bibliotheca Mexicana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> It was intended to
cover all authors born in New Spain; but though
he lived to arrange the work through the letter
J, only A, B, and C were published. All titles
are translated into Latin. Its incompleteness
renders the bibliographical parts of Maneiro’s <i>De
Vitis Mexicanorum</i> (1791) more necessary, and
makes Beristain’s <i>Bibliotheca Hispano-Americano
Septentrional</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> of three volumes, published at
Mexico in 1816, 1819, and 1821, of more importance
than it would otherwise be. Beristain,
also, only partly finished his work; but a nephew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
completed the publication. It has become rare;
and its merits are not great, though its notices
number 3,687.</p>

<p>Of more use to the student of the earlier history,
however, is the list which Clavigero gives
in his <i>Storia del Messico</i> published in 1780. A
Jesuit, and a collector, having a book-lover’s keen
scent, he surpassed all writers on the theme who
had preceded him, in amassing the necessary
stores for his special use. Since his day the field
has been surveyed more systematically both by
the general and special bibliographers. The student
of early Spanish-Mexican history will of
course not forget the help which he can get from
general bibliographers like Brunet, from the <i>Dictionary</i>
of Sabin, the works of Ternaux and Harrisse,
the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, not to speak of
other important library catalogues.</p>

<p>The sale catalogues are not without assistance.
Principal among them are the collections
which had been formed by the Emperor Maximilian
of Mexico,&mdash;which was sold in Leipsic in
1869 as the collection of José Maria Andrade,<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a>&mdash;and
the <i>Bibliotheca Mexicana</i> formed by José
Fernando Ramirez, which was sold in London
in 1880.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a></p>

<p>All other special collections on Mexico have
doubtless been surpassed by that which has
been formed in San Francisco by Mr. Hubert
Howe Bancroft, as a component part of his
library pertaining to the western slope of America.
Lists of such titles have been prefixed to
his histories of <i>Central America</i> and of <i>Mexico</i>,
and are to be supplemented by others as his
extended work goes on. He has explained, in
his preface to his <i>Mexico</i> (p. viii), the wealth of
his manuscript stores; and it is his custom, as it
was Prescott’s, to append to his chapters, and
sometimes to passages of the text, considerable
accounts, with some bibliographical detail, of the
authorities with which he deals.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> Helps, though

references to them.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE cartographical history of the Pacific coast of North America is one of shadowy

the coming of Europeans, the possibility of the very existence of such a coast; since their
Asiatic theory of the new-found lands maintained with more or less modification a fitful
existence for a full century after Columbus. In many of the earliest maps the question
was avoided by cutting off the westerly extension of the new continent by the edge of the

in the Portuguese <i>portolano</i>, which is placed between 1516 and 1520, Mahometan flags
are placed on the coasts of Venezuela and Nicaragua.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<p>In 1526 a rare book of the monk Franciscus, <i>De orbis situ ac descriptione Francisci

from the Asiatic coast by a strait in the neighborhood of Tehuantepec, with the legend,
“Hoc orbis hemisphærium cedit regi Hispaniæ.”<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> A few years later we find two other
maps showing this Asiatic connection,&mdash;one of which, the Orontius Finæus globe, is well
known, and is the earliest engraved map showing a return to the ideas of Columbus. It
appeared in the Paris edition of the <i>Novus Orbis</i> of Simon Grynæus, in 1532,<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> and was

much later in the <i>Geografia</i> of Lafreri

<p>The same view is maintained in a manuscript map of Ruscelli,
the Italian geographer, preserved in the British Museum. Perhaps the earliest instance of
a connection of America and Europe, such as Ruscelli here imagines, is the map of
“Schondia,” which Ziegler the Bavarian published in his composite work at Strasburg in
1532,<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> in which it will be observed he makes “Bacallaos” a part of Greenland, preserving
the old notion prevailing before Columbus, as shown in the maps of the latter part of
the fifteenth century, that Greenland was in fact a prolongation of northwestern Europe,
as Ziegler indicates at the top of his map, the western half of which only is here reproduced.</p>

<p>From
Kohl’s sketch, preserved in his manuscript in the library of the American Antiquarian
Society, the annexed outline is drawn. Furlani is reported to have received it from a
Spanish nobleman, Don Diego Hermano, of Toledo.<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> The connection with Asia is again
adhered to in Johannes Myritius’s <i>Opusculum geographicum</i>, where the map is dated 1587,
though the book was published at Ingolstadt in 1590.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> Just at this time Livio Sanuto, in
his <i>Geografia distinta</i> (Venice, 1588), was disputing the Asiatic theory on the ground that
the Mexicans would not have shown surprise at horses in Cortés’ time, if they had formerly
been inhabitants of a continent like Asia, where horses are common. Perhaps the
latest use of the type of map shown in the “Carta Marina” of 1548 was just a half century
later, in 1598, in an edition of Ortelius, <i>Il Theatro del mondo</i>, published at Brescia.
The belief still lingered for many years yet in some quarters; and Thomas Morton in
1636 showed that in New England it was not yet decided whether the continent of America
did not border upon the country of the Tartars.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> Indeed, the last trace of the assumption
was not blown away till Behring in 1728 passed from the Pacific to the Arctic seas.</p>

<p class="p2">Such is in brief the history of the inception and decline of the belief in the prolongation
of Asia over against Spain, as Toscanelli had supposed in 1474, and as had been suspected
by geographers at intervals since the time of Eratosthenes.<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> The beginning of the
decline of such belief is traced to the movements of Cortés. Balboa in 1513 by his discovery
of the South Sea, later to be called the Pacific Ocean,<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> had established the continental
form of South America, whose limits southward were fixed by Magellan in 1520; but it was
left for Cortés to begin the exploration to the north which Behring consummated.</p>

<p>After the Congress of Badajos had resolved to effect a search for a passage through
the American barrier to the South Sea, the news of such a determination was not long in
reaching Cortés in Mexico, and we know from his fourth letter, dated Oct. 15, 1524, that it
had already reached him, and that he had decided to take part in the quest himself by
despatching an expedition towards the Baccalaos on the hither side; while he strove also
to connect with the discoveries of Magellan on the side of the South Sea.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> Cortés had
already been led in part by the reports of Balboa’s discovery, and in part by the tidings
which were constantly reaching him of a great sea in the direction of Tehuantepec, to
establish a foothold on its coast, as the base for future maritime operations. So his explorers
had found a fit spot in Zacatula, and thither he had sent colonists and shipwrights
to establish a town and build a fleet,<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> the Emperor meanwhile urging him speedily to use
the vessels in a search for the coveted strait, which would open a shorter passage than
Magellan had found to the Spice Islands.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> But Cortés’ attention was soon distracted by
his Honduras expedition, and nothing was done till he returned from that march, when
he wrote to the Emperor, Sept. 3, 1526, offering to conduct his newly built fleet to the
Moluccas.</p>

         <p class="pf400">Kohl gives this old Portuguese chart of
the Pacific in his Washington Collection, after
an original preserved in the military archives at
Munich, which was, as he thinks possible, made
by some pilot accompanying Antonio da Miranda
de Azevedo, who conducted a Portuguese fleet
to the Moluccas in 1513 to join the earlier
expedition (1511) under D’Abreu and Serraō.
A legend at Maluca marks these islands as the
place “where the cloves grow,” while the group
south of them is indicated as the place “where
nutmegs grow.” The coast on the right must
stand for the notion then prevailing of the main
of America, which was barring the Spanish
progress from the east.</p>

<p class="pf400">Of the early maps of the Moluccas, there is
one by Baptista Agnese in his <i>portolano</i> of 1536,

in the Museum; and one of 1568, by J. Martines.

<p>But two other fleets were already on the way thither,&mdash;one under Garcia
de Loaysa which left Spain in August, 1525, and the other under Sebastian Cabot, who
stopped on the way at La Plata, had left in April, 1526. So Cortés finally received orders
to join with his fleet that of Loaysa, who had indeed died on his voyage, and of his vessels
only one had reached the Moluccas. Another, however, had sought a harbor not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
from Zacatula, and had brought Cortés partial tidings at least of the mishaps of Loaysa’s
undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> What information the rescued crew could give was made use of, and Cortés,
bearing the whole expense, for a reimbursement of which he long sued the home Government,
sent out his first expedition on the Pacific, under the command of his cousin Alvaro
de Saavedra Ceron, armed with letters for Cabot, whose delay at La Plata was not suspected,
and with missives for sundry native potentates of the Spice Islands and that region.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a></p>

<p>After an experimental trip up the coast, in July, 1527,<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> two larger vessels and a brigantine
set sail Oct. 31, 1527. But mishap was in store. Saavedra alone reached the Moluccas,
the two other vessels disappearing forever. He found there a remnant of Loaysa’s
party, and, loading his ship with cloves, started to return, but died midway, when the crew
headed their ship again for the Moluccas, where they fell at last into Portuguese prisons,
only eight of them finally reaching Spain in 1534.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Portuguese, following in the track of Vasco da Gama,
had pushed on beyond the great peninsula of India, and had reached the Moluccas in 1511,
where they satisfied themselves, if their longitude was substantially correct, that there was
a long space intervening yet before they would confront the Spaniards, pursuing their
westerly route. It was not quite so certain, however, whether the line of papal demarcation,
which had finally been pushed into the mid-ocean westerly from the Azores, would
on this opposite side of the globe give these islands to Spain or to themselves. The
voyage of Magellan, as we shall see, seemed to bring the solution near; and if we may
believe Scotto, the Genoese geographer, at about the same date (1520) the Portuguese had
crossed the Pacific easterly and struck our northwest coast.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> The mishaps of Loaysa
and Saavedra, as well as a new understanding between the rival crowns of the Iberian
peninsula, closed the question rather abruptly through a sale in 1529&mdash;the treaty of
Saragossa&mdash;by Spain, for 350,000 ducats, to Portugal of all her rights to the Moluccas
under the bull of demarcation.<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a></p>

<p>Cortés, on his return from Spain (1530), resolved to push his discoveries farther up
the coast. The Spaniards had now occupied Tehuantepec, Acapulco, and Zacatula on the
sea, and other Spaniards were also to be found at Culiacan, just within the Gulf of California
on its eastern shore. The political revolutions in Cortés’ absence had caused the
suspension of work on a new fleet, and Cortés was obliged to order the construction of
another; and the keels of two were laid at Tehuantepec, and two others at Acapulco. In
the early part of 1532 they were launched, and in May or June two ships started under
Hurtado de Mendoza, with instructions which are preserved to us. It is a matter of doubt
just how far he went,<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> and both vessels were lost. Nuño de Guzman, who held the region
to the north,<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> obstructed their purpose by closing his harbors to them and refusing
succor; and Cortés was thus made to feel the deadliness of his rivalry. The conqueror
now himself repaired to Tehuantepec, and superintended in person, working with his men,
the construction of two other ships. These, the “San Lazaro” and “Concepcion,” under
Diego Becerra, left port on the 29th of October, 1533, and being blown to sea, they first saw
land in the latitude of 29° 30´ north on the 18th of December, when, coasting south and
east, they developed the lower parts of the Californian peninsula. Mutiny, and attacks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
the natives, during one of which the chief pilot Ximenes was killed, were the hapless
accompaniments of the undertaking, and during stress of weather the vessels were separated.
The “San Lazaro” finally returned to Acapulco, but the “Concepcion” struggled
in a crippled condition into a port within Guzman’s province, where the ship was seized.
A quarrel ensued before the <i>Audiencia</i>, Cortés seeking to recover his vessel; but he prospered
little in his suit, and was driven to undertake another expedition under his own
personal lead. Sending three armed vessels up the coast to Chiametla, where Guzman had
seized the “Concepcion,” Cortés went overland himself, accompanied by a force which
Guzman found it convenient to avoid. Here he joined his vessels and sailed away with
a part of his land forces to the west; and on the 1st of May, 1535, he landed at the Bay
of Santa Cruz, where Ximenes had been killed. What parts of the lower portion of the
Californian peninsula Cortés now coasted we know from his map, preserved in the Spanish
Archives,<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> which accompanied the account of his taking possession of the new land of
Santa Cruz, “discovered by Cortés, May 3, 1535,” as the paper reads. The point of
occupation seems to have been the modern La Paz, called by him Santa Cruz. The
notary’s account of the act of possession goes on to say,<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the third day of May, in the year of our Lord 1535, on the said day, it may be at the hour
of noon, be the same less or more, the very illustrious Lord don Hernando Cortés, Marquis of
the Valley of Guaxaca, Captain-general of New Spain and of the Southern Sea for his Majesty,
etc., arrived in a port and bay of a country newly discovered in the same Southern Sea, with a ship
and armament of the said Lord Marquis, at which said port his Lordship arrived with ships and
men, and landed on the earth with his people and horses; and standing on the shore of the sea
there, in presence of me Martin de Castro, notary of their Majesties and notary of the Administration
of the said Lord Marquis, and in presence of the required witnesses, the said Lord Marquis
spoke aloud and said that he, in the name of His Majesty, and in virtue of his royal provision,
and in fulfilment of His Majesty’s instructions regarding discovery in the said Southern Sea, had
discovered with his ship and armament the said land, and that he had come with his armament
and people to take possession of it.”</p>

<p class="p1">Finding his men and horses insufficient for the purposes of the colony which he
intended to establish, Cortés despatched orders to the main for assistance, and, pending
its arrival, coursed up the easterly side of the gulf, and opportunely fell in with one
of his vessels, much superior to his own brigantine. So he transferred his flag, and,
returning to Santa Cruz, brought relief to an already famishing colony.</p>

<p>News reaching him of the appointment of Mendoza as viceroy, Cortés felt he had
greater stake in Mexico, and hurriedly returned.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> Not despairing of better success in
another trial, and spurred on by indications that the new viceroy would try to anticipate
him, he got other vessels, and, putting Francisco de Ulloa in charge, despatched them
(July 8, 1539) before Guzman’s plan for their detention could be put into execution.
Ulloa proceeded up the gulf nearly to its head, and satisfied himself that no practicable
water passage, at least, could bring him to the ocean in that direction, as Cortés had
supposed.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> Ulloa now turned south, and following the easterly coast of the peninsula
rounded its extremity, and coursed it northerly to about 28° north latitude, without finding
any cut-off on that side. So he argued for its connection with the main.<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a></p>

<p>And here Cortés’ connection with discoveries on the Pacific ends; for Mendoza, who had visions
of his own, thwarted him in all subsequent attempts, till finally Cortés himself went to
Spain. The name which his captains gave to the gulf, the Sea of Cortés, failed to abide.
It grew to be generally called the Red Sea, out of some fancied resemblance, as Wytfliet
says, to the Red Sea of the Old World. This appellation was supplanted in turn by the
name of California, which, it is contended, was given to the peninsula by Cortés himself.<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a></p>

<p>The oldest map which we were supposed to possess of these explorations about the
gulf,<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> before Dr. Hale brought the one, already mentioned, from Spain, was that of Castillo,
of which a fac-simile is herewith given as published by Lorenzana in 1770, at Mexico, in his
<i>Historia de Nueva España</i>. Castillo was the pilot of the expedition, sent by Mendoza to
co-operate by sea with the famous expedition of Coronado,<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> and which the viceroy put under
the command of Hernando d’Alarcon. The fleet, sailing in May, 1540, reached the head of
the gulf, and Alarcon ascended the Colorado in boats; but Marcou<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> thinks he could not
have gone up to the great cañon, which however he must have reached if his supposed
latitude of 36° is correct. He failed to open communication with Coronado, but buried
some letters under a cross, which one of that leader’s lieutenants subsequently found.<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, vol. i. p. 153, gives
a sketch of this map, and again in <i>North Mexican
States</i>, i. 81; but he carries the outer coast
of the peninsula too far to the west.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In 1542 and 1543 an expedition which started under Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese
in the Spanish service, explored the coast as far as 44° north,<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> reaching that
point by coasting from 33°, where he struck the land. He made a port which he calls
San Miguel, which Bancroft is inclined to believe is San Diego; but the accounts are too
confused to track him confidently,<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> and it is probable that Cabrillo’s own vessel did
not get above 38°, for Cabrillo himself died Jan. 3, 1543, his chief pilot, Ferrelo (or
Ferrer), continuing the explorations.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> Bancroft does not think that the pilot passed

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus from the time when Balboa discovered the South Sea, the Spanish had taken
thirty years to develop the coast northerly, to the latitude of Oregon. In this distance
they had found nothing of the Straits of Anian, which, if Humboldt<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> is correct, had begun

a portion is also given in his <i>Discovery of
Maine</i>, p. 298. It is evidently of a later date
than another of his in which the west coast
is left indefinite, and which is assigned to about
1530. In the present map he apparently embodied
Cabot’s discoveries in the La Plata,
but had not heard of Orellana’s exploration
of the Amazon in 1542; though he had got news
of it when he made his map of 1558. A marked
peculiarity of the map is the prolongation of
northwestern Europe as “Terra Nova,” which
probably means Greenland,&mdash;a view entertained
before Columbus.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There seems to have been a general agreement among cartographers for some years
yet to consider the newly discovered California as a peninsula, growing out of the
concurrent testimony of those who, subsequent to Cortés’ own expedition, had tracked
both the gulf and the outer coast. The Portuguese map given by Kunstmann<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> shows
it as such, though the map cannot be so early as that geographer places its anterior limit
(1530), since the development of the gulf could not have been made earlier than 1535;
unless by chance there were explorations from the Moluccas, of which we have no record.
The map in this part bears a close resemblance to a manuscript chart in the British
Museum, placed about 1536, and it seems probable that this is the approximate date of
that in Kunstmann. The California peninsula is shown in much the same way in a map
which Major ascribes to Baptista Agnese, and places under 1539.<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> It belongs (pl. iv.) to

extends farther north than
Cabrillo had reached in

important feature. Not so,

<p>In the map of Juan Freire, 1546, we have a development of the coast northward from
the peninsula, for which it is not easy to account; and the map is peculiar in other respects.
The annexed sketch of it follows Kohl’s drawing of an old <i>portolano</i>, which he took from
the original while it was in the possession of Santarem. Freire, who was a Portuguese
hydrographer, calls it a map of the Antipodes, a country discovered by Columbus, the
Genoese. It will be observed that about the upper lake we have the name “Bimini
regio,” applied to Florida after the discovery of Ponce de Leon, because of the supposition
that the fountain of youth existed thereabout. The coasts on both sides of the gulf
are described as the discovery of Cortés. There seems to be internal evidence that
Freire was acquainted with the reports of Ulloa and Alarcon, and the chart of Castillo;
but it is not so clear whence he got the material for his draft of the more westerly
portions of the coast, which, it will be observed, are given much too great a westerly
trend. The names upon it do not indicate any use of Cabrillo’s reports; though from
an inscription upon this upper coast Freire credits its discovery to the Spaniards, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
orders from the emperor,
conducted by one Villalobos.
Kohl could not
find any mention of such
an explorer, but conjectured
he was perhaps
the one who before Cabrillo,
as Herrera mentions,
had named a river
somewhere near 30° north
latitude “Rio de Nuestra
Señora,” and which Cabrillo
sought. Kohl also
observes that though the
coast line is continuous,
there are places upon it
marked “land not seen,”
with notes of its being
again seen west of such
places; and from this he
argues that the expedition
went up and not down
the coast. It not unlikely
had some connection with
the fleet which Ruy Lopez
de Villalobos conducted
under Mendoza’s orders,
in November, 1542, across
the Pacific to the islands
on the Asiatic coast.<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a></p>

<p>In 1554 Agnese again
depicts the gulf, but does
not venture upon drawing
the coast above the
peninsula, which in turn
in the Vopellio map of
1556,<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> and in that in

the gulf indenting more
nearly at a right angle.

a type of map for the shores of the northern Pacific, and for prefiguring Behring’s
Straits, which we shall later frequently meet. Mention has already been made of the

“Nueva Hispania” is the type of the
gulf given in the 1548 edition. The

(Washington Collection) of the general map
of the world, contained in a manuscript vellum
atlas in the British Museum (no. 9,814), from
the collection of the Duke de Cassano Serra.
It is elaborately executed with miniatures and
figures. The language of the map is chiefly
Italian, with some Spanish traces. Kohl
believes it to be the work of Joannes Martines,
the same whose atlas of 1578 is also in the
Museum, and whose general map (1578) agrees
in latitudes and other particulars with this.
The present one lacks degrees of longitude,
which the 1578 map has, as well as the name
“America,” wanting also in this. Kohl places
it not long after the middle of the sixteenth
century. In the <i>Catalogue of Manuscript Maps</i>,
i. 29, the atlas of 1578 is mentioned as containing
the following numbers relating to
America: 1. The world. 2. The two hemispheres.
3. The world in gores. 10. West
coast of America. 11. Coast of Mexico. 12-13.
South America. 14. Gulf of Mexico. 15. Part
of the east coast of North America.</p>

<p class="pf250">In the Museum manuscripts, no. 22,018, is

<p>Of the explorations of Francis Drake in 1579 we have no cartographical record,
except as it may be embodied in the globe of Molineaux, preserved in the Middle
Temple, London, which is dated 1592, and in the map of the same cartographer, dated
1600.<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> Molineaux seemingly made use of the results of Cabrillo’s voyage, as indicated by
the Spanish names placed along the coast. It was one of the results of Drake’s voyage
that the coast line of upper California took a more northerly trend. The map of Dr. Dee
(1580) evidently embodied the views of the Spanish hydrographers.<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a></p>

There has been much controversy over the
latitude of Drake’s extreme northing, fixed, as
it will be seen in this map, at about 48°, which
is the statement of the <i>World Encompassed</i>,
and by the <i>Famous Voyage</i>, at 43°. The two
sides were espoused warmly and respectively
by Greenhow in his <i>Oregon and California</i>, and
by Travers Twiss in his <i>Oregon Question</i>, during
the dispute between the United States and
Great Britain about the Oregon boundary.
Bancroft (<i>Northwest Coast</i>, vol. i. p. 144), who
presents the testimony, is inclined to the lower
latitude.</p>

<p>After the Spaniards had succeeded, in opposition to the Portuguese, in establishing
a regular commerce between Acapulco and Manilla (Philippine Islands), the trade-winds
conduced to bring upper California into better knowledge. The easterly trades carried
their outward-bound vessels directly west; but they compelled them to make a détour
northward on their return, by which they also utilized the same Japanese current which
brought the Chinese to Fusang<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> many centuries before. An expedition which Don Luis de
Velasco had sent in 1564, by direction of Philip II., accompanied by Andres de Urdaneta,
who had been in those seas before with Loaysa in 1525, had succeeded in making a permanent
occupation of the Philippines for Spain in 1564. It became now important to find
a practicable return route, and under Urdaneta’s counsel it was determined to try to find it
by the north. One of the galleons deserted, and bearing northerly struck the California
coast near Cape Mendocino, and arrived safe at Acapulco three months before Urdaneta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
himself had proved the value of his theory. The latter’s course was to skirt the coast of
Japan till under 38°, when he steered southerly; and after a hard voyage, in which he saw
no land and most of his crew died,
he reached Acapulco in October.<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a>
Other voyages were made in succeeding
years, but the next of which
we have particular account was that
of Francisco Gali, who, returning
from Macao in 1584, struck the California
coast in 37° 30´, and marked
a track which other navigators later
followed.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a></p>

<p>The map (1587) in Hakluyt’s
Paris edition of Peter Martyr conformed
more nearly to the Mercator
type;<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> and Hakluyt, as well as Lok,
records Drake’s discovery, both of
them putting it, however, in 1580.</p>

<p>With the year 1588 is associated
a controversy over what purports to
be a memoir setting forth the passage
of the ship of a Spanish navigator,
Lorenzo Ferrer de Maldonado,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
through a strait a quarter of a league
wide. The passage took him as high
as 75°; but he reached the Pacific
under the sixtieth parallel. The
opening was identified by him with the long-sought Straits of Anian. The belief in this
story had at one time some strong advocates, but later geographical discoveries have of
course pushed it into the limbo of forgotten things; for it seems hardly possible to
identify, as was done by Amoretti, the narrow passage of Maldonado, under 60°, with
that which Behring discovered, sixteen leagues wide, under 65°.<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a></p>

<p>In 1592 we have the alleged voyage of De Fuca, of which he spoke in 1596, in Venice,
to Michael Lok, who told Purchas; and he in turn included it in his <i>Pilgrims</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> He told

by Cavendish,<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a>&mdash;a statement
which some have
thought confirmed by
Cavendish’s own avowal
of his taking a pilot on
that coast,&mdash;and that at
the north he had entered
a strait a hundred miles
wide, under 47° and 48°,
which had a pinnacle
rock at the entrance; and
that within the strait he
had found the coast
trending northeast, bordering
a sea upon which
he had sailed for twenty
days. This story, despite
its exaggerations,
and though discarded
formerly, has gained
some credence with later
investigators; and the
application of his name
to the passage which
leads to Puget Sound
seems to have been the
result of a vague and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
general concurrence, in the belief of some at least, that this passage must be identified with
the strait which De Fuca claimed to have passed.<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a></p>

<p>With the close of the sixteenth century, the maps became numerous, and are mostly of
the Mercator type. Such are those of Cornelius de Judæis in 1589 and in 1593,<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> the draughts

<p>An important voyage in both furthering and confusing the knowledge of the California
coast was that of Sebastian Viscaino.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> This navigator, it is sometimes said, had been in
a Manilla galleon which Cavendish had captured near Cape St. Lucas in 1587, when the
English freebooter burned the vessel and landed her crew.<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> He is known to have had
much opportunity for acquiring familiarity with the coast; and in 1597 he had conducted
an expedition to the coast of the California peninsula which had failed of success.<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a></p>

<p>In 1602 (May 5) he was again despatched from Acapulco with three vessels, for the
same purpose of discovering some harbor up the coast which returning vessels from the
Philippines could enter for safety or repairs, and of finding the mysterious strait which
led to the Atlantic. He was absent ten months.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> He himself went up to 42°, but one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
his vessels under Martin Aguilar proceeded to 43°, where he reported that he found the
entrance of a river or strait, not far from Cape Blanco;<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> and for a long period afterwards
the entrance and Aguilar’s name stood together on the maps.<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> Buache, in his <i>Considérations
géographiques et physiques</i>, says that it was the reports brought back from this expedition,
describing an easterly trend of the coast above the 43°, which gave rise to the notion that
the waters of the Gulf of California found a passage to the ocean in two ways, making an
island of the peninsula. The official recorder of the expedition (Ascension) is known to
have held this view. We shall see how fixed this impression later became.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the peninsular shape was still maintained in the map in Botero’s <i>Relaciones
Universales del mundo</i>, published at Valladolid in 1603; in the Spanish map of 1604, made
at Florence by Mathieu Neron Pecciolen (engraved for Buache in 1754); in that of
Cespedes’ <i>Regimiento de Navigacion</i> (1606), and in that published in connection with
Ferdinand de Quir’s narrative in the <i>Detectionis Freti</i> (1613) of Hudson’s voyage.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p>A map of Jodocus Hondius of about this time first gave indication of the growing
uncertainty which led finally to a prevailing error regarding the head of the gulf. The
map was inscribed “Vera totius expeditionis nauticæ Descriptio D. Franc. Draci,” etc.,
and illustrated Hondius’s edition of Drake and Cavendish’s voyages, and has been reproduced
in the Hakluyt Society’s edition of <i>The World Encompassed</i>. The gulf is
made to divide about an island at its northern end, producing two arms whose prolongation
is left undecided. The circumpolar map of Hondius which appeared in Pontanus’s
<i>Amsterdam</i> in 1611, and is given in fac-simile in Asher’s <i>Henry Hudson</i>, shows the Straits
of Anian, but nothing more. Another Hondius map in the Mercator of 1613 turns the
coast easterly, where the Straits of Anian separate it from Asia. The same atlas of 1613
contains also the America of Michael Mercator, which is of the usual Gerard Mercator type,
with the enclosed northern sea contracted to narrow limits and called “Mare dulce.” A
similar western coast is drawn in the America of Johannes Oliva of Marseilles, preserved
in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a></p>

<p>In Kasper van Baerle’s edition of Herrera, published at Amsterdam in 1622, we get&mdash;as
far as has been observed&mdash;the earliest<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> insularizing of the California peninsula, and this
only by a narrow thread of water connecting a large gulf below and a smaller one above.
And even this attempt was neutralized by a second map in the same book, in which these
two gulfs were not made to mingle their waters. A bolder and less equivocal severing of
the peninsula followed in the maps of two English geographers. The first of these is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
map of Master Briggs.<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> In this the island stretches from 23° to 44°, showing Cape Blanco,
with Cape Mendocino and “Po. S<sup>r</sup>. Francisco Draco” south of it, the latter in about 38°.
The map bears the following legend: “California, sometymes supposed to be part of y<sup>e</sup>
Westerne continent; but since by a Spanish charte taken by y<sup>e</sup> Hollanders it is found to
be a goodly Ilande, the length of the west shoare beeing about 500 leagues from Cape
Mendocino to the south cape thereof called Cape St. Lucas, as appeareth both by that
Spanish Chart, and by the relation of Francis Gaule [Gali], whereas in the ordinarie
charts it is sett downe to be 1700 leagues.”<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> The other was that given in John Speed’s
<i>Prospect</i>, which contains one of the maps of Abraham Goos of Amsterdam, “described
and enlarged by I. S. Ano. 1626.” This carries up the outer coast of the island beyond
the “Po[rto] Sir Francisco Dr[ake]” and Cape Mendocino. The coast of the main
opposite the northern end of the island ceases to be defined, and is continued northerly
with a dotted line, while the western shore of Hudson’s Bay is also left undetermined.<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a>
De Laet, however, in 1630 still kept to the peninsula, placing “Nova Albion” above it.<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a>
In 1636 W. Saltonstall’s English translation of Hondius’s Mercator presents an island,
with the now somewhat common break in the main coast opposite its northern end.
This gap is closed up, however, in another map in the same volume.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></p>

St. Lawrence rising close to it, and flowing very near also to Hudson’s Bay in its easterly
passage.</p>

<p>The circumstantial story of Bartolemé de Fonte, whose exploits are placed in 1640, at
one time commanded a certain degree of confidence, and made strange work with the cartographical
ideas of the upper part of the Pacific coast. It is now believed that the story
was coined by James Petiver, one of the contributors to the <i>Monthly Miscellany, or Memoirs
for the Curious</i>, published in London in April and June, 1708, in which first appeared what
purported to be a translation of a letter of a certain Admiral De Fonte.<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a> In this a Spanish
navigator&mdash;whose name was possibly suggested by a veritable De Fonta who was exploring
Tierra del Fuego in 1649&mdash;was made to depart from Callao, April 3, 1640, and proceed up
the coast to 53°, above which he navigated a net-work of interior waters, and encountered
a ship from Boston which had entered these regions from the Atlantic side.<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
archipelago, as it seemed, he gave the name of St. Lazarus; and to a river, leading from a
lake with an island in it, he applied that of Velasco; and these names, curiously, appear in
the fanciful maps which were made by Delisle and Buache in elucidation of the voyage in
which they expressed not a little faith, though the Spanish antiquaries early declared that
their archives contained no record of the voyage.<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a></p>

<p>The Dutch, under De Vries, in 1643 had pushed up from Japan, and discovered, as
they thought, an island, “Jesso,” separated from land on the west by a water which they
called the “Detroit de Vries,” and on the American side by a channel which had an uncertain
extension to the north, and might after all be the long-sought Straits of Anian.<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> The
idea of an interjacent land in the north Pacific between America and Asia is also said to
have grown out of the report of a Portuguese navigator, Don João da Gama, who claimed
to have seen such a land in sailing from China to New Spain. It long maintained a fleeting
existence on the maps.<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a></p>

<p>Two maps of Petrus Koerius, dated 1646, in Speed’s <i>Prospect</i> (1668), indicate what
variable moods geographers could assume in the same year. In one we have an island and
a determinate coast line running north to the straits; in the other we have a peninsula
with two different trends of the coast north of it in half-shading. We owe to an expatriated
Englishman a more precise nomenclature for the western coast than we had had
previous to the appearance of his maps in 1646; and the original manuscript drawings
preserved at Munich are said by Dr. Hale to be richer still in names.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> This is the
<i>Arcano del mare</i> of Robert Dudley. He was born in Surrey in 1573, and whether the
natural or legitimate son of the Earl of Leicester depends on the proof of the secret
marriage of that nobleman with Lady Sheffield. An adventurous spirit kept him away
from the enjoyment of Kenilworth, which he inherited, and he was drawn nearer to the
associations of the sea by marrying a sister of Cavendish. He was among the many
Englishmen who tried their daring on the Spanish main. He married a second wife, a
daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh, whom he abandoned, partly to be rid of a stepmother;
and out of chagrin at his failure to secure the dukedom of Northumberland, which had
been in abeyance since the execution of his grandfather, Lady Jane Grey’s adherent, he
sold Kenilworth to young Prince Henry, and left England in company with a daughter of
Sir Robert Southwell. He now gave himself up to practical seamanship and the study
of hydrography. The grand-duke of Tuscany gave him employment, and he drained
a morass to enable Leghorn to become a beautiful city.</p>

<p>Under authority of Ferdinand
II., he assumed the title of Duke of Northumberland, which was recognized
throughout the empire. He died in 1639.<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> The <i>Arcano</i> has thirty-three American maps;
but the Munich manuscript shows thirteen more. One of the Pacific coast, which records
Drake’s explorations, is annexed; but with Dudley’s text<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> there is another showing the
coast from Cape Mendocino south, which puts under thirty degrees north a “golfo profondo”
of undefined inland limits, with “I di Cedros” off its mouth. The bay with the
anchor and soundings just north of thirty degrees, called in the fac-simile “P<sup>to</sup> di Nouova
Albion,” corresponding, it would seem, to San Francisco, is still seen in this other chart,
with a more explicit inscription,&mdash;“Po: dell nuovo Albion scoperto dal Drago C<sup>no</sup>
Inglese.”</p>

<p>In 1649, in Texeira’s chart, there is laid down for the first time a sketch of the coast
near the Straits of Anian, which is marked as seen by João da Gama, and extends easterly
from Jesso, in the latitude of 50°. Gama’s land lived for some time in the charts.<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a></p>

<p>We have another of Speed’s maps, five years later (1651), which appears in the 1676
edition of his <i>Prospect</i>, in which that geographer is somewhat confused. He makes California
an island, with a break in the coast line of the main opposite its northern extremity,
and its northwest point he calls “C. Mendocino,” while “Pt. Sir Francisco Draco” is
placed south of it; but rather confusedly another Cape Mendocino projects from the main
coast considerably further to the north.<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> A map of Visscher in 1652<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> reverts, however,
to the anterior notions of Mercator; but when in 1655 Wright, an Englishman, adopted
Mercator’s projection, and first made it really serviceable for navigation, in his <i>Certain
Errors in Navigation</i>, he gave an insular shape to California.</p>

<p>The French geographer Nicolas Sanson<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> introduced a new notion in 1656. California
was made an island with “P<sup>to</sup> de Francisco Draco” on the west side, somewhat
south of the northern cape of it. On the main the coast in the same latitude is made to
form a projection to the north called “Agubela de Cato,” without any extension of the
shore farther northward. The map in Petavius’s (Petau’s) <i>History of the World</i> (London,
1659) carries the coast up, but leaves a gap opposite the northern end of the insular
California. The atlas of Van Loon (1661) converts the gap into the Straits of Anian, and
puts a “terra incognita” north of it. Danckerts of Amsterdam in the same year (1661),
and Du Val in various maps of about this time make it an island. The map of 1663,
which appeared in Heylin’s <i>Cosmographie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> gives the insular California, and a dotted line
for the main coast northward, with three alternative directions. A map of the Sanson
type is given in Blome’s <i>Description of the World</i>, 1670. Ogilby’s map in 1671 makes it
an island,<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> following Montanus’s <i>Nieuwe Weereld</i>.</p>

<p>Hennepin had in his 1683 map made California a peninsula, and in that of 1697 he still
preserved the gulf-like character of the waters east of it; but the same plate in the 1698
edition is altered to make an island, as it still is in the edition of 1704. The French
geographer Jaillot, in 1694, also conformed to the insular theory, as did Corolus Allard
in his well-known Dutch atlas. Campanius, copying Hennepin, speaks of California as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
the largest island “which the Spaniards possess in America. From California the land
extends itself [he says] to that part of Asia which is called Terra de Jesso, or Terra
Esonis. The passage is only through the Straits of Anian, which hitherto has remained
unknown, and therefore is not to be found in any map or chart,”&mdash;all of which shows
something of Campanius’s unacquaintance with what had been surmised, at least, in
cartography. All this while Blaeu in his maps was illustrating the dissolving geographical
opinions of his time. In 1659 he had drawn California as an island; in 1662 as a
peninsula; and once more, in 1670, as an island. Coronelli in 1680, and Franquelin in his
great manuscript map of 1684 had both represented it as an island.<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a></p>

<p>In 1698 the English geographer Edward Wells, in his <i>New Sett of Maps</i>, showed
a little commendable doubt in marking the inlet just north of the island as “the supposed
Straits of Anian,”&mdash;a caution which Delisle in 1700, with a hesitancy worthy of the
careful hydrographer that he was destined to become, still further exemplified. While
restoring California to its peninsular character, he indicated the possibility of its being
otherwise by the unfinished limitations of the surrounding waters.<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> Dampier in 1699,
in chronicling the incidents of the voyage with which he was connected, made it an
island.<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a></p>

<p>In 1701 one would have supposed the question of the insularity of California would
have been helped at least by the explorations overland of Father Kino the Jesuit which
were begun in 1698. His map, based rather upon shrewd conjecture than upon geographical
discovery, and showing the peninsular form of the land, was published in the
<i>Lettres Edifiantes</i>, vol. v., in 1705.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> In 1705 the map in Harris’s <i>Collection of Voyages</i>
preserves the insular character of California.<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> In 1715 Delisle<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> expressed himself as
undecided between the two theories respecting California,<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> but in 1717 he gave the weight
of his great name<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> to an imagined but indefinite great gulf north of the California
peninsula, which held for a while a place in the geography of his time as the “Mer de
l’ouest.” Homann, of Nuremberg, in 1719 marked the entrance of it, while he kept to the
insular character of the land to the south; as did Seutter in his <i>Atlas Geographicus</i>
published at Augsburg in 1720. Daniel Coxe in his <i>Carolana</i> had a sufficient stock of
credulity&mdash;if he was not a “liar,” as Bancroft calls him<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>&mdash;in working up some wondrous
stories of interior lakes emptying into the South Sea.<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> In 1727 the English cartographer
Moll converted the same inlet into the inevitable Straits of Anian. The maps in such
popular books as Shelvocke’s <i>Voyages</i> (1726)<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> and Anson’s <i>Voyages</i> (1748), as did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
sundry maps issued by Vander Aa of Amsterdam, still told the mass of readers of the
island of California; as had Bruzen la Martinière in his <i>Introduction à l’histoire</i> (1735),
and Salmon (using Moll’s map of 1736) in his <i>History of America</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, without knowing it because of the fogs, Behring, in 1728, had pushed
through the straits now known by his name into the Arctic Seas, and had returned along
the Asiatic shore in continued ignorance of his accomplishment. It was not till 1732
that another Russian expedition was driven over to the Alaskan shore; and in 1738 and
1741 Behring proved the close proximity of the two continents, and made demonstration
of their severance.</p>

<p>At this time also the English were making renewed efforts from the side of Hudson’s
Bay to reach the Pacific; and Arthur Dobbs, in his <i>Countries adjoining to Hudson’s Bay</i>
(1744), gives a variety of reasons for supposing a passage in that direction, showing possible
solutions of the problem in an accompanying map.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a></p>

<p>The Spaniards, who were before long to be spurred on to other efforts by the reports
of Russian expeditions, were reviving now, through the 1728 edition of Herrera, more
confidence in the peninsular character of California; though Mota Padilla in his <i>Nueva
Galicia</i>, in 1742, still thought it an island.</p>

<p>The French map-maker Bellin, in his cartographical illustrations for Charlevoix in
1743, also fell into the new belief; as did Consag the Jesuit, in a map which he made
in 1746.<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a></p>

<p>The leading English geographer Bowen in 1747 was advocating the same view, and
defining the more northerly parts as “undiscovered.” In 1748 Henry Ellis published his
<i>Voyage to Hudson’s Bay</i>,&mdash;made in 1746-1747, and mentions a story that a high or low
tide made California an island or a peninsula, and was inclined to believe in a practicable
northwest passage.<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> In 1750 Robert de Vaugondy, while preserving the peninsula, made
a westerly entrance to the north of it, which he marks as the discovery of Martin d’Aguilar.
The lingering suspicion of the northerly connection of the California Gulf with the ocean
had now nearly vanished; and the peninsula which had been an island under Cortés, then
for near a century connected with the main, and then again for more than a century in many
minds an island again, was at last defined in its proper geographical relations.<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a></p>

<p>The coast line long remained, however, shadowy in the higher latitudes. Buriel, in
his editorial notes to Venegas’s <i>California</i>, in 1757, confessed that nothing was known.
The French geographers, the younger Delisle and Buache,<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> published at this time various
solutions of the problem of straits and interior seas, associated with the claims of Maldonado,
De Fuca, and De Fonte; and others were found to adopt, while others rejected,
some of their very fanciful reconciling of conflicting and visionary evidences, in which the
“Mer de l’ouest” holds a conspicuous position.<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> The English map-maker Jefferys at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
the same epoch (1753) was far less complex in his supposition, and confined himself to a
single “river which connects with Lake Winnepeg.” A map of 1760, “par les S<sup>rs</sup> Sanson,
rectifiée par S<sup>r</sup> Robert,” also indicates a like westerly entrance; and Jefferys again in 1762,
while he grows a little more determinate in coast lines, more explicitly fixes the passage
as one that Juan de Fuca had entered in 1592.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> The <i>Atlas Moderne</i>, which was published
at Paris, also in 1762, in more than one map, the work of Janvier, still clung to the
varieties presented by Delisle ten years before, and which Delisle himself the next year
(1763) again brought forward. In 1768 Jefferys made a map<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> to illustrate the De Fonte
narrative; but after 1775 he made several studies of the coast, and among other services
reproduced the map which the Russian Academy had published, and which was a somewhat
cautious draught of bits of the coast line here and there, indicating different landfalls,
with a dotted connection between them.<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> One of Jefferys’s own maps (1775) carries the
coast north with indications of entrances, but without attempting to connect them with
any interior water-sheds. Going north from New Albion we then find on his map the
passage of D’Aguilar in 1603; then that of De Fuca, “where in 1592 he pretends he went
through to the North Sea;” then the “Fousang” coast, visited by the Spaniards in 1774;
then Delisle’s landfall in 1741; Behring’s the same year; while the coast stops at Mount
St. Elias. In his 1776 map Jefferys gives another scheme. “Alaschka” is now an island
athwart the water, dividing America from Asia, with Behring’s Straits at its western end;
while the American main is made up of what was seen by Spangenberg in 1728, with a
general northeasterly trend higher up, laid down according to the Japanese reports. The
Spaniards were also at this time pushing up among the islands beyond the Oregon coast.<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a>
In 1774 Don Juan Perez went to Nootka Sound, as is supposed, and called it San Lorenzo.<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a>
In 1775 another Spanish expedition discovered the Columbia River.<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> Janvier in 1782
published a map<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> still perpetuating the great sea of the west, which Buache and others had
delineated thirty years before. The English in 1776 transferred their endeavors from
Hudson’s Bay to the Pacific coast, and Captain James Cook was despatched to strike the
coast in the latitude of Drake’s New Albion, and proceed north in search of a passage eastward.<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a>
Carver the traveller had already, in 1766-1768, got certain notions of the coast from
Indian stories, as he heard them in the interior, and embodied them with current beliefs
in a map of his own, which made a part of his <i>Travels through the interior parts of North
America</i>, published in 1778. In this he fixed the name of Oregon for the supposed great
river of the west, which remained in the end attached to the region which it was believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
to water.<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> In 1786 the Frenchman La Pérouse was on the coast.<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> In 1789 the English and
Spanish meeting on the coast, the English commander was seized. This action led to a
diplomatic fence, the result of which was the surrender of Nootka to the English.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a Boston ship, the “Columbia,” commanded by Captain Kendrick, in company
with the “Washington” (Captain Gray), was on a voyage, which was the first American
attempt to sail around the globe.<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> They entered and named the Columbia River; and
meeting Vancouver, the intelligence was communicated to him. When the English commander
occupied Nootka, the last vestige of uncertainty regarding the salient features of
the coast may be said to have disappeared under his surveys. Before they were published,
George Foster issued in 1791 his map of the northwest coast, in which the Straits of Juan
de Fuca were placed below 40°, by which Captain Gray is supposed to have entered, on
his way to an open sea, coming out again in 55°, through what we now know as the Dixon
entrance, to the north of Queen Charlotte’s Island; the American navigator having
threaded, as was supposed, a great northern archipelago. Vancouver’s own map finally
cleared the remaining confusion, and the migratory Straits of Juan de Fuca were at last
fixed as the channel south of Vancouver’s Island which led to Puget Sound.<a name="FNanchor_1411_1411" id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a></p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mercator’s Projection.</span>&mdash;It was no new
thing to convert the spherical representation
of the earth into a plane on the cylindrical
principle, for it had been done in the fourteenth
century; but no one had devised any method by
which it could be used for a sea-chart, since the
parallelizing of the meridians altered the direction
of point from point. Mercator seems to
have reasoned out a plan in this wise: A B
and C D are two meridians drawing together
as they approach the pole. If they are made
parallel, as in E F and G H, the point 2 is
moved to 3, which is in a different direction
from 1, in the parallel of latitude, I J. If the
line of direction from 1 to 2 is prolonged till
it strikes the perpendicular meridian G H at
4, the original direction is preserved, and the
parallel K L can then be moved to become
M N; thus prolonging the distance from 1 to
5, and from 6 to 4, to counteract the effect on
direction by perpendicularizing the meridians.
To do this accurately involved a law which
could be applicable to all parallels and meridians;
and that law Mercator seems only to
have reached approximately. But the idea
once conveyed, it was seized by Edward Wright
in England in 1590, who evolved the law, and
published it with a map, the first engraved on
the new system, in his <i>Certain Errors of Navigation</i>,
London, 1599. Mead, in his <i>Construction
of Maps</i> (1717), examined all previous systems
of projections; but contended that Varenius
in Latin, and his follower Newton in English,
had not done the subject justice. There have
been some national controversies over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
claims of the German Mercator and the English
Wright; but D’Avezac, in his “Coup d’Œil
historique sur la projection des cartes de géographie,”
printed in the <i>Bulletin de la Société de
Géographie</i>, 1863 (also separately), defends Mercator’s
claims to be considered the originator
of the projection; and he (pp. 283-285) gives references
to writers on the subject, who are also
noted in Van Raemdonck’s <i>Mercator</i>, p. 120.</p>

<p>The claim which Van Raemdonck had made
in his <i>Gérard Mercator, sa vie et ses œuvres</i>,&mdash;that
the great geographer was a Fleming,&mdash;was
controverted by Dr. Breusing in his <i>Gerhard
Kremer, gen. Mercator, der Deutsche Geograph</i>,
1869, and in an article (supposed to be
his) in the <i>Mittheilungen aus Justus Perthes’
Geographischer Anstalt</i>, 1869, vol. xi. p. 438,
where the German birth of Mercator is contended
for. To this Van Raemdonck replied in
his <i>Gérard de Cremer, ou Mercator, Géographe
Flamand</i>, published at St. Nicholas in 1870.
The controversy rose from the project, in 1869,
to erect a monument to Mercator at Duisburg.
Cf. also Bertrand in the <i>Journal des Savants</i>,
February, 1870.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Ortelius.</span>&mdash;Ortelius was born in 1527, and
died in 1598, aged seventy-one years. He was
a rich man, and had visited England in his
researches. Stevens says in his <i>Bibliotheca historica</i>
p. 133: “A thorough study of Ortelius
is of the last importance.... He was a bibliographer,
a cartographer, and an antiquary, as
well as a good mathematician and geographer;
and what is of infinite importance to us now,
he gave his authorities.” Cf. also “La Généalogie
du Géographe Abraham Ortelius,” by
Génard in the <i>Bulletin de la Société Géographique
d’Anvers</i>, v. 315; and Felix Van Hulst’s <i>Life of
Ortelius</i>, second edition, Liege, 1846, with a portrait,
which can also be found in the 1580, 1584,
and perhaps other editions of his own <i>Theatrum</i>.
There is also a brief notice, by M. de Macedo, of
his geographical works in <i>Annales des Voyages</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 184-192. Thomassy (<i>Les Papes géographes</i>,
p. 65) has pointed out how Ortelius fell
into some errors, from ignorance of Ruscelli’s
maps, in the 1561 edition of Ptolemy. The engraver
of his early editions was Francis Hagenberg,
and of his later ones, Ferdinand Orsenius
and Ambroise Orsenius. He prefixed to his
book a list of the authorities, from whose labors
he had constructed his own maps. It is a most
useful list for the students of the map-making
of the sixteenth century. It has not a single
Spanish title, which indicates how closely the
Council for the Indies had kept their archives
from the unofficial cartographers. The titles
given are wholly of the sixteenth century, not
many anterior to 1528, and mostly of the latter
half of the century, indeed after 1560; and
they are about one hundred and fifty in all.
The list includes some maps which Ortelius had
not seen; and some, to which in his text he
refers, are not included in the list. There are
some maps among them of which modern inquiry
has found no trace. Stevens, in unearthing
Walter Lud, turned to the list and found
him there as Gualterus Ludovicus. (See <i>ante</i>,
p. 162).</p>

<p>Ortelius supplied some titles which he had
omitted,&mdash;including some earlier than 1528,&mdash;as
well as added others produced in the interval,
when, in 1592, he republished the list in its
revised state. Lelewel has arranged the names
in a classified way in his <i>Géographie du moyen
âge</i>, vol. ii. pp. 185, 210, and on p. 217 has given
us an account of the work of Ortelius. Cf. also
Lelewel, vol. v. p. 214; Sabin, vol. xiv. p. 61.</p>

<p>The original edition of the <i>Theatrum</i> was
issued at Antwerp, in Latin, and had fifty-three
maps; it was again published the same year
with some changes. There are copies in Mr.
Brevoort’s, Jules Marcou’s collections, and in the
Carter-Brown, Harvard College, and Astor libraries.
Stevens, in his illustrated <i>Bibliotheca
geographica</i>, no. 2,077, gives a fac-simile of the
title. Cf. also <i>Huth Catalogue</i>, vol. iii. p. 1068;
<i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, vol. i. no. 278; and
Muller, <i>Books on America</i> (1877), no. 2,380.</p>

<p>The third Latin edition appeared the next
year (1571) at Antwerp, with the same maps, as
did the first edition with Dutch text, likewise
with the same maps. Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca historica</i>,
no. 1,473, thinks the Dutch is the original
text.</p>

<p>To these several editions a supplement or
additamentum, with eighteen new maps (none,
however, relating to America), was added in
1573. Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>; Brockhaus, <i>Americana</i>
(1861), no. 28. Muller, <i>Books on America</i>
(1877), no. 2,381.</p>

<p>The same year (1573, though the colophon
reads “Antorff, 1572”) the first German edition
appeared, but in Roman type, and with a somewhat
rough linguistic flavor. It had sixty-nine
maps, and included the map of America.
Koehler, of Leipsic, priced a copy in 1883 at
100 marks. The Latin (Antwerp) edition of
this year (1573), “nova editio aliquot iconibus
aucta,” seems also to have the same peculiarity
of an earlier year (1572) in the colophon <i>Huth
Catalogue</i> (vol. iii. p. 1068). Copies of all these
editions seem to vary in the number of the
maps. (<i>Library of Congress Catalogue</i>; <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, and the catalogues of Quaritch,
Weigel, and others.) In 1574 some of the
Antwerp issues have a French text, with maps
corresponding to the German edition.</p>

<p>There are copies of the 1575 edition in the
libraries of Congress, Harvard College, and the
Boston Athenæum; and the four maps of interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
in American cartography may be described from
the Harvard College copy. They are reproductions
of the maps of the 1570 edition.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Mappemonde. North America has a perfected
outline much as in the Mercator map,
with “Anian regnum” at the northwest. North
America is marked, as by Wytfliet, “America
sive India nova;” but the geography of the
Arctic and northeastern parts is quite different
from Wytfliet. Groclant and Groenland have
another relative position, and take a general
trend east and west; while in Wytfliet it is
north and south. Northern Labrador is called
Estotilant; while Frisland and Drogeo, islands
to the south and east of it, are other reminders
of the Zeni chart. This same map was reissued
in the 1584 edition; and again, new cut, with
a few changes, and dated 1587, it reappeared
in the 1597 edition.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The two Americas. Anian and Quivira
are on the northwest coast of North America.
Tolm and Tototeac are northeast of the Gulf
of California, and mark the region where the
St. Lawrence rises, flowing, without lakes, to
the gulf, with Terra Corterealis on the north
and Norumbega on the south. Estotilant is
apparently north of Hudson’s Straits, and off
its point is Icaria (another Zeni locality), with
Frislant south of it. Newfoundland is cut into
two large islands, with Baccalaos, a small island
off its eastern coast. South America has the
false projection (from Mercator) on its southwestern
coast in place of Ruscelli’s uncertain
limits at that point. This projecting coast
continued for some time to disfigure the outline
of that continent in the maps. This map also
reappeared in the 1584 edition.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Scandia, or the Scandinavian regions, and
the North Atlantic show Greenland, Groclant,
Island, Frisland, Drogeo, and Estotilant on a
large scale, but in much the same relation to
one another as in the map <i>a</i>. East of Greenland,
and separated from it by a strait, is a
circumpolar land which has these words:
“Pygmei hic habitant.” The general disposition
of the parts of this map resembles Mercator’s,
and it was several times repeated, as
in the editions of Ortelius of 1584 and 1592;
and it was re-engraved in Münster’s <i>Cosmographia</i>
of 1595, and in the Cologne-Arnheim
Ptolemy of 1597.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Indiæ orientalis. It shows Japan, an
island midway in a sea separating Mangi (Asia)
on the west from “Americæ sive Indie occidentalis
pars” on the east. This map also
reappeared in the 1584 edition, and may be
compared with those of the Wytfliet series.</p>

<p class="p2">In 1577 an epitome of Ortelius by Heyn,
with a Dutch text and seventy-two maps,
appeared at Antwerp.</p>

<p>In 1580 the German text, entirely rewritten,
appeared at Antorff, with a portrait of Ortelius
and twenty-four new maps (constituting the
third supplement), with a new general map of
America. Among the new maps was one of
New Spain, dated 1579, containing, it is reckoned,
about a thousand names; another showing
Florida, Northern Mexico, and the West India
Islands; and a third on one sheet showing
Peru, Florida, and Guastecan Regio.</p>

<p>The Latin edition of 1584, with a further
increase of maps, is in Harvard College Library.
In 1587 there was a French text issued, the
mappemonde of which is reproduced in Vivien
de St. Martin’s <i>Histoire de la géographie</i>.
This text in the 1588 edition is called “revue,
corrigé et augmentée pour la troisième fois.”
This French text is wholly independent of, and
not a translation of, the Latin and German.
The maps are at this time usually ninety-four in
number. In 1589 there was Marchetti’s edition
at Brescia and a Latin one at Antwerp. In
1591 there was a fresh supplement of twenty-one
maps. In 1592 the Antwerp edition was the
last one superintended by Ortelius himself.
The map of the New World was re-engraved,
and the maps number in full copies two hundred
and one, usually colored; there is a copy in
Harvard College Library. In 1593 there was
an Italian text, and other Latin editions in
1595 and 1596, a copy of the last being in
Harvard College Library. This completes the
story of the popularity of Ortelius down to
the publication of Wytfliet, when American
cartography obtained its special exponent.</p>

<p>A few later editions may mark the continued
popularity of the work of Ortelius, and of those
who followed upon his path:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Il theatro del mondo</i>, Brescia (1598), one hundred
maps, of which three are American.</p>

<p>A French text at Antwerp (1598), with one
hundred and nineteen maps, including the same
American maps as in the 1587 edition, except
that of the world and of America at large.</p>

<p>Peeter Heyn’s <i>Miroir du monde</i>, Amsterdam
(1598), with eighty woodcut maps,&mdash;an epitome
of Ortelius.</p>

<p>After Ortelius’s death, the first Latin edition
in 1601, at Antwerp (111 maps), had his final
corrections; other issues followed in 1603, 1609
(115 maps), 1612, 1624, with an epitome by Crignet
in 1602 (123 maps); and an epitome in
English in 1610. An Italian text by Pigafetta
appeared in 1612 and 1697.</p>

<p>Lelewel (<i>Géographie du moyen âge</i>; vol. ii. pp.
181, 185, and <i>Epilogue</i>, p. 214) has somewhat
carefully examined the intricate subject of the
make-up of editions of Ortelius; but the truth
probably is, that there was much independent
grouping of particular copies which obscures
the bibliography.</p>

<p class="pc1 large">EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF NEW MEXICO.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY HENRY W. HAYNES.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Archæological Institute of America.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AT the time of the Spanish conquest of Mexico there were living, some
fifteen hundred miles to the north of the city so named, in the upper
valley of the Rio del Norte, and upon some of the eastern affluents of the
Colorado of the West, certain native tribes, who had attained to a degree
of culture superior to that of any people in North America, with the exception
of the semi-civilized Aztec and Maya races. These were the Sedentary
or Pueblo Indians,&mdash;village communities dwelling together in large
buildings constructed of stone or adobe,&mdash;whose home lay principally
within the present limits of New Mexico and Arizona, although extending
somewhat into southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah. The first
rumors of the existence of this people which had reached the ears of the
Spaniards grew out of a tale told to Nuño de Guzman in 1530, when
he was at the head of the Royal Audience then governing New Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a>
He had an Indian slave, called by the Spaniards Tejos, who represented
himself to be a son of a trader in feathers, such as were used by the natives
for head-dresses. Tejos said that it was his father’s habit to travel about,
exchanging his wares for silver and gold, which were abundant in certain
regions. Once or twice he had accompanied his father on these journeys,
and then he had seen cities large enough to be compared with Mexico.
They were seven in number, and entire streets in them were occupied by
jewellers. To reach them it was necessary to travel northward forty days’
journey through a desert region lying between the two seas.</p>

<p>Guzman placed confidence in this narrative; and collecting a force of
four hundred Spaniards and twenty thousand Indians, he set out from
Mexico in search of this country. It was believed to be only about six
hundred miles distant, and already the name of <i>The Land of the Seven
Cities</i> had been given to it. There were also other strange stories current,
that had been told to Cortés a few years before, about a region called Ciguatan,
lying somewhere in the north, near to which was an island inhabited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
solely by Amazons. In this, also, there was said to be gold in abundance;
and it was quite as much the hope of finding the Island of the Amazons,
with its gold, that inspired Guzman’s expedition, as of gaining access to the
treasures of The Seven Cities. But on his march confirmatory reports
about these cities kept reaching him; and eventually the expedition succeeded
in penetrating to Ciguatan, and even as far within the province of
Culiacan, the extreme limit of Spanish discovery, as to Colombo. Nevertheless,
they did not find the Island of the Amazons, and The Seven Cities
kept receding farther toward the north.<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> Meanwhile one of his captains
made a reconnoissance some seventy leagues in an easterly direction without
any satisfactory result. At last, the difficulties of an advance through
a wild country and amid pathless mountains brought the expedition to a
halt, which soon dampened the ardor of the soldiers, who grew clamorous
to return to Mexico. But in the mean time news had reached Guzman
that Cortés was once more there, clothed with new titles and authority, and
he did not dare to brave the anger which his hostile proceedings during
Cortés’ absence were sure to have provoked. Accordingly he retraced his
steps no farther than to Compostella and Guadalaxara, where he remained,
and established the colonies from which was formed the province known
afterwards as New Gallicia.<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> Not long after, he was deposed from his
authority as governor of this province by direct commands from Spain;
and Antonio de Mendoza, who had now been created Viceroy of New
Spain, appointed Francisco Vasquez de Coronado to the vacant post.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Indian Tejos had died, and the mysterious Seven Cities
would have remained only a name, if the interest in them had not been
revived by a remarkable occurrence. This was the arrival in the province
of Culiacan, in 1536, of Antonio Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, with three companions.
They were the sole survivors of the numerous company who
had followed Pamphilo de Narvaez, in 1527, to the shores of Florida.
During nine years of almost incredible perils and hardships, after traversing
in their wanderings all the great unknown region lying north of
the Gulf of Mexico, they had at last reached the shores of the southern
sea. They brought back accounts of having fallen in with civilized peoples,
dwelling in permanent habitations, where were “populous towns with very
large houses.”<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> The story of their strange adventures is told elsewhere in
more detail,<a name="FNanchor_1416_1416" id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> so that here it suffices to put on record simply that they were
the first Europeans to tread the soil of New Mexico. As soon as they
reached Mexico, the intelligence of their discoveries was communicated to
the Viceroy Mendoza, by whom it was at once transmitted to Coronado,
the new governor of New Gallicia. He was a gentleman of good family,
from Salamanca, but long established in Mexico, where he had married a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
daughter of Alonzo d’Estrada, former governor of that place, who was
generally believed to be a natural son of Ferdinand the Catholic. Coronado
at this time was occupied in travelling through New Spain; but he repaired
immediately to his province to investigate the reports, taking with him one
of Cabeza de Vaca’s companions, a negro named Stephen, and also three
Franciscan monks, missionaries to the natives. After a brief interval a
proposition was made to one of these monks, Fray Marcos de Nizza (of
Nice), to undertake a preliminary exploration of the country. He was
selected for this task on account of his character and attainments, and because
of the experience he had acquired in Peru, under Alvarado. Elaborate
instructions were sent to him by the Viceroy, which seem inspired by a
spirit of humanity as well as intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_1417_1417" id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> He was told that the expedition
was to be undertaken for the spread of the holy Catholic faith, and that he
must exhort the Spaniards to treat the natives with kindness, and threaten
them with the Viceroy’s displeasure if this command should be disobeyed.
The natives were to be informed of the Emperor’s indignation at the cruelties
that had been inflicted upon them, and to be assured that they should
no longer be enslaved or removed from their homes. He was ordered to
take the negro Stephen as his guide, and cautioned against giving any
ground of offence to the natives. He was to take special note of their
numbers and manner of life, and whether they were at peace or war among
themselves. He was also to observe particularly the nature of the country,
the fertility of the soil, and the character of its products; to learn what wild
animals were to be found there, and whether there were any rivers, great or
small. He was to search for precious stones and metals, and if possible to
bring back specimens of them; and to make inquiry whether the natives
had any knowledge of a neighboring sea. If he should succeed in reaching
the southern sea, he was to leave an account of his discoveries buried at
the foot of some conspicuous tree marked with a cross, and to do the same
thing at the mouths of all rivers, so that any future maritime expedition
might be instructed to be on the lookout for such a sign. Especially was
he ordered to send back constant reports as to the route he had taken, and
how he was received; and if he should discover any great city, he was to
return immediately to give private information about it. Finally, he was
told to take possession of the new country in the name of the Emperor, and
to make the natives understand that they must submit themselves to him.</p>

<p>In accordance with these instructions, Fray Marcos set out from S. Miguel
de Culiacan on the 7th of March, 1539, with Fray Honoratus for a companion,
and the negro Stephen for a guide. The monks were not greatly pleased
with this man, on account of his avaricious and sensual nature; but they
hoped to reap some benefit from his ability to communicate with the natives,
several of whom, who had been brought away from their homes by Cabeza
de Vaca, but who had been redeemed and set free by the Viceroy, also
accompanied the party. There was, besides, a much larger company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
natives from the neighboring regions, who were induced to join the expedition
on account of the favorable representations made to them by those
whom the Viceroy had freed.</p>

<p>Fray Marcos, upon his return, made a formal report of all his doings;<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> and
to this we must look for the first definite information in regard to the early
exploration and history of the region with which we are now concerned,
since Cabeza de Vaca’s narrative is too confused to furnish any sure indications
of locality, and he has even been charged by Castañeda with
“representing things very differently from what he had found them in
reality.”<a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a> The monk relates how they reached Petatlan, after having met
with great kindness from the natives on their way; and while resting there
for three days Fray Honoratus fell ill, and was obliged to be left behind.
He himself continued his journey for some thirty leagues, still finding the
natives most friendly, and even willing to share with him their supply of
food, although it was but scanty, owing to no rain having fallen for three
years. On his way he was met by some inhabitants of the island, which
had previously been visited by Cortés, by whom he was assured that it was
indeed an island, and not a continent as some had supposed. Still other
people came to visit him from a larger island, but more distant, who informed
him that there were still thirty islands more, but that they were only poorly
supplied with food.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a> These Indians wore shells suspended from their necks,
like those in which pearls are found; and when a pearl was shown to them,
they said they had an abundance of them, although the friar admits that
he himself did not see any. After this his route lay for four days through
a desert, during which he was accompanied by the Indians from the
islands and the inhabitants of the villages through which he had passed.
Finally he came to a people who were astonished to see him, as they had
no intercourse with the people on the other side of the desert, and had no
knowledge whatsoever of Europeans. Nevertheless, they received him kindly,
and supplied him with food, and endeavored to touch his garments, calling
him “a man sent from heaven.” In return, he endeavored, as best he
might by means of interpreters, to teach them about “God in heaven, and
his Majesty upon earth.” Upon being asked if they knew of any country
more populous and civilized than their own, they replied that four or five
days’ journey into the interior, in a great plain at the foot of the mountains,
there were many large cities, inhabited by a people who wore garments
made of cotton. When specimens of different metals were shown to them,
they selected the gold, and said that this people had their common dishes
made of this material, and wore balls of it suspended from their ears and
noses, and even used “thin plates of it to scrape off their sweat.” However,
as this plain was quite remote from the sea, and as it was his purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
never to be far away from it during his journeyings, the monk decided to
defer the exploration of this country until his return.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fray Marcos continued to travel for three days through the
territories of the same tribe, until he arrived at a town of moderate size,
called Vacapa, situated in a fertile region about forty leagues from the
sea.<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> Here he rested for several days, while three exploring parties were
despatched to the coast with directions to bring back some of the natives
dwelling there as well as upon the neighboring islands, in order that he
might obtain more definite information about those regions. The negro
was ordered to advance in a northerly direction fifty or sixty leagues, and
to send back a report of what he should discover. In four days’ time a
messenger came from him bringing news of “a country the finest in the
world;” and with him came an Indian, who professed to have visited it,
and who reported that it was a thirty days’ journey from the place where
Stephen then was to the first city of this province. The name of this
province was Cibola,<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> and it contained seven great cities, all under the
rule of one lord. The houses were built of stone and lime; some of them
were three stories high, and had their doorways ornamented with turquoises,
of which there was an abundance in that country; beyond this,
there were still other provinces all greater than that of The Seven Cities.
This tale was all the more readily credited by the monk, as the man
appeared to be “of good understanding.” Nevertheless, he deferred his
departure until the exploring parties should return from the coast. After
a short time they came back, bringing with them some of the dwellers
upon the coast and on two of the islands, who reported that there were
thirty-four islands in all, near to one another; but that all, as well as the
main land, were deficient in food supplies. They said that the islanders
held intercourse with each other by means of rafts, and that the coast
stretched due north. On the same day there came to Vacapa, to visit the
monk, three Indians who had their faces, hands, and breasts painted. They
said that they dwelt in the eastern country, in the neighborhood of Cibola,
and they confirmed all the reports in regard to it.</p>

<p>As fresh messengers had now come from Stephen, urging the monk to
hasten his departure, he sent the natives of the coast back to their homes
and resumed his journey, taking with him two of the islanders&mdash;who
begged to accompany him for several days&mdash;and the painted Indians.
In three days’ time he arrived among the people who had given the
negro his information about Cibola. They confirmed all that had been
said about it; and they also told about three other great kingdoms, called
Marata, Acus, and Totonteac. They said they were in the habit of going
to these countries to labor in the fields, and that they received in payment
turquoises and skins of cattle. All the people there wore turquoises in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
their ears and noses, and were clad in long cotton robes reaching to their
feet, with a girdle of turquoises around the waist. Over these cotton
garments they wore mantles made of skins, which were considered to be
the clothing best suited to the country. They gave the monk several of
these skins, which were said to come from Cibola, and which proved to
be as well dressed and tanned as those prepared by the most highly civilized
people. The people here treated him with very great kindness,
and brought the sick to him to be healed, and endeavored to touch his
garments as he recited the Gospels over them. The next day he continued
his journey, still attended by the painted Indians, and arrived at
another village, where the same scenes were repeated. He was told that
Stephen had gone on four or five days’ journey, accompanied by many of
the natives, and that he had left word for Fray Marcos to hasten forward.
As this appeared to be the finest country he had found thus far, he proceeded
to erect two crosses, and to take formal possession of it in the name
of the Emperor, in accordance with his instructions. He then continued on
his journey for five days more, passing through one village after another,
everywhere treated with great kindness, and receiving presents of turquoises
and of skins, until at last he was told that he was on the point of coming
to a desert region. To cross this would be five days’ march; but he was
assured that provisions would be transported for him, and places provided
in which he could sleep. This all turned out as had been promised, and
he then reached a populous valley, where the people all wore turquoises in
greater profusion than ever, and talked about Cibola as familiarly as did
the Spaniards about Mexico or Quito. They said that in it all the products
of civilization could be procured, and they explained the method by
which the houses were constructed of several stories.</p>

<p>Up to this point the coast had continued to run due north; but here,
in the latitude of 35°, Fray Marcos found, from personal examination, that
it began to trend westward. For five days he journeyed through this fertile
and well-watered valley, finding villages in it at every half-league, when
there met him a native of Cibola, who had fled hither from the governor of
that place. He was a man advanced in years, and of good appearance and
capacity; and from him were obtained even more definite and detailed
accounts of Cibola and the neighboring kingdoms, their condition and
mode of government; and he begged to be allowed to return home in the
friar’s company, in order to obtain pardon through his intercession. The
monk pursued his way for three days more through this rich and populous
valley, when he was informed that soon another desert stretch, fifteen long
days’ march in extent, would begin. Accordingly, as he had now travelled
one hundred and twelve leagues from the place where he had first learned
of this new country, he determined to rest here a short time. He was told
that Stephen had taken along with him more than three hundred men as
his escort, and to carry provisions across the desert; and he was advised
to do likewise, as the natives all expected to return laden with riches. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
Fray Marcos declined; and selecting only thirty of the principal men, and
the necessary porters, he entered upon the desert in the month of May, and
travelled for twelve days, finding at all the halting-places the cabins which
had been occupied by Stephen and other travellers. Of a sudden an Indian
came in sight, covered with dust and sweat, with grief and terror stamped
upon his countenance. He had been one of Stephen’s party, and was the
son of one of the chiefs who were escorting the friar. This was the tale he
told: On the day before Stephen’s arrival at Cibola, according to his custom,
he sent forward messengers to announce his approach. These carried
his staff of office, made of a gourd, to which was attached a string of bells
and two feathers, one white and one red, which signified that he had come
with peaceful intentions and to heal the sick. But when this was delivered
to the governor, he angrily dashed it to the ground, saying he knew the strangers,
and forbade their entering the city, upon pain of death. This message
was brought back to Stephen, who nevertheless continued on, but was prevented
from entering the city. He was conducted to a large house outside
the walls, where everything was taken from him; and the whole party passed
the night without food or drink. The following morning, while the narrator
had gone to the river which flowed near by, to quench his thirst, suddenly
he saw Stephen in full flight, pursued by the people of Cibola, who were
slaying all of his companions; whereupon he hid himself under the bank,
and finally succeeded in escaping across the desert. When they heard this
pitiful story, the Indians began to wail, and the monk to tremble for his own
life; but he says he was troubled still more at the thought of not being
able to bring back information about this important country. Nevertheless,
he proceeded to cut the cords of some of his packages, from which he had
as yet given nothing away, and to distribute all the contents among the
chief men, bidding them fear nothing, but continue on with him still farther;
which they did, until they came within a day’s journey of Cibola. Here
there met them two more of Stephen’s Indian companions, still bleeding from
their wounds, who told the same story about his death and the destruction of
his company, supposing that they alone had escaped, by hiding themselves
under the heaps of those who had been slain by flights of arrows.<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a></p>

<p>The monk goes on to relate that he tried to comfort the weeping natives,
by telling them that God would punish the people of Cibola, and the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
would send an army to chastise them; but they refused to believe him,
saying no power could resist that of Cibola. He thereupon distributed
everything he had left among them to appease them, and endeavored to
persuade some of them to go nearer the city, in order to make sure of the
fate of the party; and upon their refusal, he said that he should at all events
endeavor to obtain a sight of Cibola. Seeing his determination, two of the
chiefs consented to accompany him; and they came to a hill, from which
they could look down upon the city. It is situated in a plain, he says, and
seemed to be handsomer and more important than any city he had yet seen,
and even larger than Mexico. The houses were built of stone, and were
of several stories, as the natives had told him, and with flat roofs; and upon
his expressing his admiration of it, his companions said that it was the
smallest of The Seven Cities, and that Totonteac, one of the neighboring
towns, was still larger and finer. With the help of the Indians he proceeded
to raise a great pile of stones, upon which he planted a cross as large as he
was able to make, and in the name of the Viceroy and Governor of New
Spain, on behalf of the Emperor, he took possession of the Land of the Seven
Cities, and the realms of Totonteac, Acus, and Marata; and to the whole
country he gave the name of the New Kingdom of St. Francis. Upon
retracing his steps across the desert, he failed to receive as friendly a reception
as before, for all the people were in tears for the loss of their murdered
relatives; so that he became alarmed, and hastened through the valley so
rapidly that in three days’ time he had crossed the second desert. From
this point he made a detour in the direction of the country lying to the
East, about which he had been told on his first coming. Without venturing
to penetrate into it, he contented himself with observing the approaches,
when he found seven small villages in a verdant valley, but in the distance
he could see the smoke of a fine city. He was informed that the country
was very rich in gold, but that the inhabitants refused all intercourse with
strangers. Nevertheless, he planted two more crosses here, and took formal
possession of the country. From this point he retraced his steps as speedily
as possible to Compostella, where he rejoined Coronado, and sent immediate
notice of his return to the Viceroy.</p>

<p>While Fray Marcos had been absent upon his journey, Coronado had
himself been occupied in searching for a province lying somewhere to the
north of his own dominions, called Topira. After a toilsome march
through a mountain region this was reached, and proved to be entirely
different from what it had been reported; and he had just returned from
this fruitless expedition, when the monk arrived. So glowing were the
accounts he gave of what he had himself seen and what the natives had
told him, as well as of the wealth to be found in the islands of the southern
seas, that Coronado determined to take the monk at once with himself to
Mexico and lay the matter before the Viceroy. There, on the 2d of September,
1539, according to the notaries’ attest, Fray Marcos presented a report in
writing to Mendoza, by whom it was transmitted to the Emperor Charles V.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
accompanied by a letter from himself containing a brief narrative of the
previous attempts that had been made for the exploration of the country.<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a>
In a very short time
Coronado began to proclaim
openly what hitherto
he had only
whispered in strictest
confidence to his most
intimate friends,&mdash;that
the marvellous Seven
Cities had been discovered
which Nuño de
Guzman had sought for
in vain; and he proceeded
forthwith to
make preparations and
to collect a military force
for their conquest.
Meanwhile the Franciscans
chose Fray Marcos for their general; and soon all the pulpits of that
Order were resounding to such good purpose, that before long an army of
three hundred Spaniards and eight hundred Indians of New Spain had been
collected. So many gentlemen of noble birth volunteered for this service
that the Viceroy was much embarrassed in selecting officers; but at last he
decided upon the principal ones, and appointed Coronado, as was only his
due, general-in-chief. Compostella, the capital of New Gallicia, was named
as the place of rendezvous for the army; and in the mean time Hernando
Alarcon received instructions to sail along the coast of the southern sea in
order to accompany the march of the expedition. He was directed to transport
the heavy stores and to keep up communications by means of the rivers
that empty into it. This part of the plan, however, failed of success, as
Coronado’s line of march soon led him to a distance from the coast.<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>In the last days of February, 1540, the Viceroy himself came to Compostella,
and from there he accompanied the army for two days on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
march. But soon the difficulties of the route began to tell upon the inexperienced
cavaliers, who were obliged each to carry his own provisions and
baggage, so that when they had reached Chiametla, they were compelled
to halt for several days in order to procure a supply of food. In doing
this a collision with the natives occurred, in which one of the superior
officers was slain; and in revenge, all who were <i>believed</i> to be inhabitants
of the village where it happened were hanged. Soon after this, dissatisfaction
began to manifest itself among the troops, which was heightened
by the discouraging reports which were spread on the return of Melchior
Diaz and his party, whom Coronado had sent by Mendoza’s orders on
a reconnoitring expedition during his own absence in Mexico. They had
penetrated two hundred leagues beyond Culiacan, as far as the edge of the
desert, and they gave very different accounts from those of Fray Marcos.
Very few inhabitants were seen, except in two or three little villages of
some thirty huts, and everywhere was a great scarcity of provisions; while
the mountainous nature of the country rendered it almost impassable.<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a>
The friar, however, strove to encourage their drooping spirits, promising
them that they should not return empty handed; and the march was continued
to Culiacan, where the expedition was received with great hospitality
by the Spanish colonists. Here Coronado left the main body of the
army under the command of Tristan d’Arellano, with orders to follow him
in a fortnight, while he himself set out on the 22d of April, 1540, with
fifty horse and a few foot-soldiers and the monks who did not choose to
be left behind. In somewhat more than a month’s time he came to the last
inhabited place on the borders of the desert, having everywhere met with
a friendly reception from the natives. At an intervening village, in the
valley which Cabeza de Vaca had called Corazones, he had halted, and
despatched messengers to the sea-coast, which was five days’ journey
distant, and learned that a vessel had been seen passing by. The place
which he had now reached bore the name of Chichilticalli, or The Red
House, and it proved to be something very different from what Fray
Marcos had reported. Instead of a populous town at a distance of five
leagues from the sea, he found merely a single ruinous, roofless structure,
at least ten days’ journey from the coast. Nevertheless, it bore
the appearance of having once been a fortified work which had been constructed
out of red earth by a civilized people, but had been destroyed
in former times by some barbarous enemy.<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> Here Coronado entered upon
the desert, and proceeding in a northeasterly direction he came in a fortnight’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
time to a river, to which the name of the Vermejo was given,
on account of its turbid waters. This was only eight leagues distant
from Cibola, where they arrived on the following day, sometime early in
July, having only escaped by the general’s prudence from falling into an
ambuscade of hostile natives.<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a></p>

<p>Cibola turned out to be even a greater disappointment than the Red
House, and many were the maledictions showered upon the monk by the
soldiers. Instead of the great city which he had reported, it proved to be
only a little village of not more than two hundred inhabitants, situated
upon a rocky eminence, and difficult of access.<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> From its resemblance in
situation, Coronado gave the name of Granada to the village; and he states
that the name Cibola properly belonged to the whole district containing
seven towns, and not to any particular place. As the natives continued to
manifest a hostile disposition, and the army was almost famished from lack
of food, it was resolved to attempt to carry it at once by assault, in order
to get at the abundance of provisions stored there. But the inhabitants
made such a stout resistance with missiles and showers of stones, that it
would have gone hard with the Spaniards if it had not been for the protection
of their armor. As it was, Coronado himself was twice felled to the
earth, and his life was only saved by the devotion of one of his officers,
who shielded him with his own body. However, in less than an hour’s
time the place was captured, though several of the horses of the Spaniards
were killed, and a few of the assailants wounded. But when once possession
of this strong point was secured, the whole district was speedily
reduced to submission.</p>

<p>Here Coronado awaited the arrival of the main body of his army before
attempting to penetrate farther into the country; and from this place he
transmitted to the Viceroy, under date of Aug. 3, 1540, a report of what he
had already accomplished, in which his disappointment about the character
of the region through which he had journeyed was very plainly expressed,
as well as his entire disbelief in the truth of the reports which
Fray Marcos had brought back respecting the rich and powerful kingdoms
lying at a distance. He shows that he had discovered the inherent defect
of the country by laying particular stress upon the “great want of pasture;”
and says that he had learned that “what the Indians worship is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
water, for it causeth their corn to grow and maintaineth their life.”<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> With
this despatch he sent specimens of the garments worn by the natives and
of their weapons, and also “two cloths painted with the beasts of the
country;” he also reports that the natives possessed a certain amount of
gold and silver, but that he could not discover whence they procured it.</p>

<p>While waiting at Cibola the arrival of the main body of the army,
Coronado sent out a small party under Pedro de Tobar to explore a province
lying some twenty leagues or more to the northwest, called Tusayan,<a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a>
where there were said to be seven cities, with houses built like those of
Cibola, and inhabited by a warlike people. Tobar succeeded in approaching
close to the first of these without being observed, as the natives now
seldom ventured far from their houses on account of the fear inspired by
the rumors spread abroad that Cibola had been captured by a fierce people
mounted upon animals that devoured human flesh. However, as soon as
the Spaniards were discovered, the natives showed a bold front, advancing
to meet them in good order, and well armed. Drawing a line in the sand,
they forbade the Spaniards crossing it, and wounded the horse of a soldier
who ventured to leap over it; whereupon a friar named Juan de Padilla,
who had been a soldier in his youth, urged the captain to make an onslaught
upon them, and the natives were soon put to flight and many of them
slain. In a short time all this province gave in its submission, and peaceable
relations were once more established. The natives brought as gifts
to the Spaniards turquoises, tanned skins, maize, and other provisions,
and especially cotton stuffs, which were regarded by them as the choicest
present, since it did not grow in their own country. They also gave information
about a large river lying farther to the west, on whose banks, at
some days’ journey down the stream, there dwelt a race of very large men.
Tobar returned to Cibola with this report, and Coronado immediately
despatched a second exploring party to verify it, under García Lopez de
Cardenas. These were well received on their way by the people of
Tusayan, who supplied them with guides and provisions for the journey.
For twenty days their march lay through a desert, at the end of which they
came to the banks of a river which seemed to them to be elevated “three
or four leagues in the air.” So steep were these banks that it was impossible
to descend to the water, which appeared so far away as to seem to be
only an arm’s-length in width, and yet their guides assured them that it
was over half a league broad. Although it was summer time, it was quite
cold, and the country was covered with a growth of stunted pines. For
three days they followed the bank in search of a passage; and some volunteers
who made the attempt returned with the report that they had only
been able to accomplish a third of the descent, and that rocks which had
seemed scarcely as high as a man, were found to be loftier than the towers
of Seville Cathedral. For three or four days more they continued on; but
at length they were forced to return by want of water, which they had been
obliged to seek for every night a league or two back from the river, and
retraced their steps to Cibola.<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a></p>

Melchior Diaz penetrated farther north,
and crossed the Colorado. Tiguex should be
placed west of the Rio Grande, between Acoma
and Quirex. The Rio “Sangra” is probably a
mistake for “Sonora.”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time the main body of the army, which had been left at
Culiacan under the command of Tristan d’Arellano, with orders to follow
Coronado in a fortnight, set out, and slowly advancing reached at length
Cabeza de Vaca’s province of Corazones. Here it was thought best to
attempt to establish a colony; but owing to the difficulty of procuring
a sufficient supply of food, it was subsequently transferred to the spot
in the valley of the river which is now called Sonora. From here Don
Roderigo Maldonado was despatched down the river in the hope of finding
Alarcon’s vessels. He returned without having accomplished his purpose,
but brought back with him a native of huge stature, and reported that a
nation of still larger men dwelt farther down the coast. The whole army
now transferred itself across the river to the new colony, and there waited
for further orders from Coronado.</p>

<p>About the middle of September, 1540,<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> Melchior Diaz and Juan
Gallegos arrived from Cibola with instructions for the army to proceed
thither at once. Gallegos continued on to Mexico, carrying to the Viceroy
an account of the discoveries; and with him went Fray Marcos, who dared
not remain any longer with the army, so incensed were they with him for
his gross misrepresentations. Diaz was ordered to remain at the new
colony in the capacity of governor, and to seek to put himself in communication
with Alarcon’s vessels. Immediately the army took up its
march for Cibola, but Arellano remained behind. As soon as they had
departed, Diaz set out to explore the sea-coast, leaving Diego d’Alcarraz
in command in his stead, who turned out to be very poorly fitted to
exercise authority, so that disorders and mutinies broke out. Diaz himself,
after marching one hundred and fifty leagues in a southwesterly
direction (as Castañeda reports),<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> struck the Tizon at some distance from
its mouth, at a place where it was at least half a league wide. Here
he found a race of huge men dwelling together in large numbers in underground
cabins roofed with straw, from whom he learned that the vessels
had been seen three days’ march down the stream. Upon reaching the
spot indicated, which the natives told him was fifteen leagues from its
mouth, he came upon a tree with an inscription upon it, and buried under
it he found a writing stating that Alarcon had come so far,<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a> and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
waiting there awhile had returned to New Spain. It also contained the
information that this supposed south sea was actually a gulf which separated
the mainland from what had been called the Island of California.
With the intention of exploring this peninsula, Diaz proceeded up the
river five or six days’ march in the hope of finding a ford, and at length
attempted to cross by means of rafts. The natives, whose assistance he
had called in to help construct them, proved treacherous, and laid a plot
to attack the Spaniards on both banks of the river, while a portion were
in the act of crossing. When this was detected, they made their assault
boldly, but were speedily put to flight. Diaz then continued his journey
along the coast, which took here a southeasterly direction, until he reached
a volcanic region where farther progress became impossible. While retracing
his steps, he met with an accident which put an end to his life;
but the rest of his party returned to Sonora in safety.</p>

<p>While Diaz was making these explorations, the main body of the army
had continued on to Chichilticalli without having encountered any other
peril than being severely poisoned from having eaten preserved fruits that
had been given to them by the natives. Castañeda records their falling
in with a flock of large mountain sheep, which ran so swiftly that they
could not be captured. When within a day’s march of Cibola they were
overtaken by a terrible storm, accompanied by a heavy snow-fall, which
caused the Spaniards great suffering, and nearly cost the lives of their
Indian allies, natives of a warm country. But on arriving they found
comfortable quarters provided by Coronado, and the whole force was
now reunited, with the exception of a detachment which had been sent
upon an expedition in an entirely different direction.</p>

<p>A party of natives had come to Cibola from a village called Cicuyé, situated
some seventy leagues away toward the east, under a chief to whom
the Spaniards gave the name of Bigotes, from the long mustache he wore.
They proffered their friendly services to the strangers and invited them to
visit their country, at the same time making them presents of tanned bison-skins.
One of them had the figure of this animal painted on his body,
which gave the Spaniards their first knowledge of its appearance. Coronado
made them in return presents of glass beads and bells, and ordered
Hernando d’Alvarado to take twenty men with him and explore that
region, and after eighty days to return and report what he had discovered.
After five days’ travel Alvarado came to a village called Acuco, situated
on a precipitous cliff so high that an arquebus-ball could scarcely reach
the top. The only approach to it was by an artificial stairway cut in the
rock, of more than three hundred steps, and for the last eighteen feet there
were only holes into which to insert the toes.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> By showing a bold front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
friendly relations were established with the inhabitants of this formidable
stronghold, who numbered some two hundred fighting men, and a large
supply of provisions was received from them. Three days’ march farther
brought them to a province called Tiguex, containing twelve villages
situated on the banks of a great river.<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> The presence in the party of
Bigotes, who was a renowned warrior well known in all that region, conciliated
the favor of the people of Tiguex; and the country pleased
Alvarado so much, that he sent a messenger to Coronado to persuade
him to make it his winter quarters.<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> Continuing his journey, in five days
more he reached Cicuyé, which he found to be a strongly fortified village
of four-story terraced houses, built around a large square. It was also
protected by a low stone wall, and was capable of putting five hundred
warriors into the field.<a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a>
Here they were welcomed
with great demonstrations
of friendship, and received

<p>This man they named “the Turk,” from his resemblance to men
of that nation; and such implicit credence did they place in his stories, that
after penetrating a little way into the plains under his guidance,&mdash;where
for the first time they saw the bisons, with whose skins they had become
familiar,&mdash;they retraced their steps in order to bring this information to
Coronado. On reaching Tiguex, Alvarado found Cardenas there, who had
been sent on by the General, in accordance with his advice, to prepare
winter quarters for the army now on its march from Sonora. Alvarado
accordingly decided to
remain in that province
and wait for the
coming of the army;
but in making their
preparations for its
comfort the Spaniards
showed very little consideration
for the natives,
forcing them to
abandon one of their
villages, taking only
the clothes that they
were wearing.</p>

<p>By this time Arellano
had arrived at
Cibola, coming from
Sonora; and to him
Coronado once more
intrusted the command of the main force, with instructions for it to rest
twenty days at Cibola, and then to proceed direct to Tiguex. He himself,
having heard of a province containing eight towns called Tutahaco, took
a party of his hardiest men and set out to explore it. On his way thither,
which took the direction of the route to Tiguex, for two days and a half
they were without water, and were forced to seek for it in a chain of snow-covered
mountains. After eight days’ march they reached this place, and
there they heard of other villages situated still farther down the river. The
people were found to be a friendly race, dwelling in buildings constructed
of earth, like those at Tiguex, which province Coronado reached by following
up the course of the river.<a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a></p>

<p>On his arrival there he found Alvarado and the Turk, who repeated
his story about the marvellous wealth to be found in his country, adding
many fanciful embellishments,&mdash;which were the more readily believed, as
he was able to distinguish copper from gold. He pretended that the
people of Cicuyé had taken some gold bracelets from him when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
made him prisoner, and Coronado accordingly sent Alvarado back to Cicuyé
to reclaim them. The people there received him again in a friendly way,
but denied all knowledge of the gold bracelets, and declared the Turk to be
a liar. Upon this, Alvarado threw the chief men of the town and Bigotes
into chains and brought them to Tiguex, where they were kept prisoners
more than six months, to the great grief and indignation of the natives,
who endeavored in vain to rescue them. This affair did much to discredit
the Spaniards in the estimation of the natives, whom their subsequent harsh
treatment soon stirred up to active resistance.</p>

<p>After the twenty days had expired, Arellano and the army started for
Tiguex, passing on their way the rock of Acuco, which many of the
Spaniards ascended to enjoy the view,&mdash;but with great difficulty, although
the native women accomplished it easily, carrying their water-jars. They
had rested, after their first day’s march, at the finest town in all the
province, where were private houses seven stories high. Here it began
to snow. It was now early in December (1540), and for ten days of their
journey the snow fell every night. But there was wood in plenty for their
fires, and they did not suffer, even finding the snow a protection. But
when they reached the village in the province of Tiguex, where their
winter quarters had been prepared, they forgot all their past toils in
listening to the delusive fables told them by the Turk. The whole
province, however, was found to be in a state of revolt, occasioned by
the severity of exactions imposed by Coronado in his anxiety for the
comfort of his men, together with the brutality of officers and soldiers
alike in carrying out his orders. The General had made requisition for
three hundred pieces of cloth; and without allowing time for the natives
to allot their several proportions to the different villages to complete
the amount, the soldiers stripped the garments off whomsoever they met,
without regard to rank or condition, and had added to the injury by
offering violence to the women. The people of one of the villages had
slain one of the Indian allies and driven off several of the horses, whereupon
Coronado had sent Cardenas with the greater part of the force to
attack it; and only after more than twenty-four hours of hard fighting,
and when many of the Spaniards had been wounded by arrows, were the
defenders at last forced to surrender by a device of the Indian allies, who
drove a mine into the lower portion of the houses, and filled them with
the smoke of burning combustibles. By an act of base treachery they
were put to death after having been promised quarter; and at once the
report was spread far and wide that the Spaniards were violators of their
solemn engagements.</p>

<p>It was just at the time of the capture of this village that the main body
of the army arrived; and then the snow began to fall and continued to do
so for two months, so that it was impossible to undertake any new enterprise.
Attempts were made, however, to conciliate the natives; but they
refused to place any confidence in the representations made to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Force was thereupon resorted to; and Cardenas, after an ineffectual attempt
upon one of the villages, came near losing his life by treachery before the
principal town of Tiguex, to which Coronado finally determined to lay
regular siege. This lasted for fifty days, during which the besieged suffered
greatly from want of water; and finally, in attempting to escape by night
they were discovered, and a great many of them were driven into the river
and perished. The Spaniards themselves suffered considerably, more than
twenty being wounded by arrows, several of whom died from bad medical
treatment. Two of the officers perished,&mdash;one killed in battle, the other
taken prisoner and carried into the town.<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a></p>

<p>During the siege Coronado himself made a brief visit to Cicuyé, for the
purpose of examining the country and restoring to his home the chieftain
whom Alvarado had brought away. At this time he promised to set
Bigotes also at liberty, when he should pass by the place on his way to
the rich countries which the Turk had told about. This delighted the
people, and he returned to the camp before Tiguex, leaving them in a very
friendly state of mind toward him.</p>

<p>About this time there arrived messengers from Alcarraz and the colony
at Sonora, bringing information of the death of Melchior Diaz, and of the
disorderly condition prevailing there. Coronado immediately despatched
Tobar to take command at that place, and to escort the messengers whom
he sent to the Viceroy to report what had already been accomplished and
the marvellous information received from the Turk. Tobar soon found
himself involved in hostilities with the natives, and lost seventeen of his
men by their poisoned arrows. Not feeling himself sufficiently secure at
Sonora, he transferred the colony to the valley of Suya, forty leagues
nearer to Cibola; and not long afterward he received orders from Coronado
to rejoin the army with the best of his force.</p>

<p>When the siege was over, an expedition was sent out to receive the
submission of the people of Chia, a large town situated four leagues west
of the river, in whose charge were left four bronze cannon which were
in a bad condition. Another expedition was equally successful in a province
of seven villages called Quirex.<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a></p>

<p>For four months the river had been closed by ice strong enough to bear a
horse; but now it had melted, and Coronado prepared to start for the lands
called Quivira, Arche, and the country of the Guyas, which the Turk declared
abounded to a greater or less degree with gold and silver. Many of the
Spaniards, however, began to have their suspicions about these fine stories.</p>

<p>The army left Tiguex, April 23, 1541,<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> for Cicuyé, twenty-five leagues
distant; and with them went Bigotes, who was set at liberty on arriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
there, to the great joy of his countrymen. Provisions in abundance were
supplied by them, besides a guide, named Xabe, a native of Quivira, who
confirmed to some extent the stories of the Turk. On quitting Cicuyé they
immediately entered the mountains, and after four days’ march came to a
broad river over which they were forced to build a bridge, which occupied
four days more.<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a> From here they journeyed in a direction north-northeast
over the plains, and in a few days fell in with immense herds of bisons. At
first there were only bulls, but some days later they came upon the cows
and calves; and at this time, after seventeen days’ march, they came upon
a band of nomads called Querechos, busy in the pursuit of the animals.
This people dwelt in tents made of tanned bison-skins stretched around
poles planted in the earth and fastened above and below. They possessed
large packs of dogs, by whom the tents were transported, and obtained their
whole sustenance by hunting the bison. Castañeda relates that on one occasion
he saw an arrow driven completely through the body of one of these
animals. The Querechos were intelligent and perfectly fearless, but friendly;
and by signs they confirmed what the Turk had said, adding that to the eastward
was a large river whose banks were thickly inhabited, and that the nearest
village was called Haxa. Two days’ march farther on, the same tribe was
again met, and they said that the villages lay still more to the east.</p>

<p>As the Turk now represented that Haxa was only two days’ march
distant, Diego Lopez was sent in advance, with ten light-armed men, to
explore it; while the army, continuing on in the same direction, fell in
with an innumerable quantity of bisons, and lost several horses in chasing
them. Lopez, after marching twenty leagues without seeing anything but
the sky and the bisons, was at last brought back by the friendly natives;
and his ill success contributed still more to discredit the Turk. One of the
force, a native of Quivira named Sopete, had given quite different information
about the route; and Coronado therefore sent out another exploring
party under Rodrigo Maldonado, who came to a village in a great ravine,
where a blind old man gave them to understand by signs that a long while
before he had seen four of their countrymen: these were believed to be
Cabeza de Vaca and his companions.<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> This people were very friendly,
and gave to the Spaniards a great quantity of tanned skins and other objects,
including a tent as large as a house. Forthwith a messenger was
despatched to bring the whole body of the soldiers to this spot, who, on
arriving, proceeded at once to divide the skins among themselves, to the
great chagrin of the natives, who had supposed that they would only bless
the skins, as Cabeza de Vaca had done, and then return them. While the
army was resting here there came a terrible storm, in which hailstones
fell of such enormous size as would have done great mischief if it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
been encountered in the open plain. A party sent out to reconnoitre
came upon another wandering tribe, called Teyas, who conducted the
army for three days’ march to their town, which was called Cona. This
people were hostile to the Querechos, and had their faces and bodies
painted; and from them guides were procured, who were not permitted
to have any communication with the Turk. These confirmed what Sopete
had said, that Quivira lay some forty days’ march in a northerly direction;
and they led the way to another great valley, a league broad, watered by a
little stream, where were vines and fruit-trees in abundance; and here the
army rested some time. As it had now become evident that the Turk had
deceived them, and as their supply of food began to run short, Coronado
called a council of war, at which it was decided that he should take thirty
of the bravest and best mounted horsemen and push on in search of
Quivira, and that the rest of the army should return to Tiguex, under the
command of Arellano. This decision, however, was not well received
by the soldiers, who besought their General not to leave them, declaring
that they were ready to die with him. But Coronado would not yield
to their wishes, and set out with his party, promising to send back word
in eight days if they might rejoin him.</p>

<p>The army waited fifteen days, during which they killed a large number
of bisons; but several of their number lost the way and were never found,
although cannon were fired and every means taken to recover them. Then
messengers arrived repeating the order to return to Tiguex, and they
quitted the valley for the country of the Teyas. This nomadic people
knew the region perfectly, and supplied them with guides, by whom they
were conducted back in twenty-five days to the river of Cicuyé, which they
struck more than thirty leagues below where they had built the bridge,
passing on their way great salt marshes. The guides told them that the
river flowed toward the east, and fell into the river of Tiguex more than
twenty days’ journey away. From this point they marched up the river
to Cicuyé, where they were no longer well received by the inhabitants,
who refused to furnish them with provisions. Accordingly they returned
to Tiguex, arriving about the middle of July, 1541.</p>

<p>In the mean time Coronado, after marching in a northerly direction over
the plains for thirty days, came to a large river, which was named for
Saints Peter and Paul. All this time he and his men had lived entirely
upon the flesh of bisons, and often had only their milk to drink. Sopete
said there were villages farther down the river; and accordingly he
followed the northern bank for three days or more in a northeasterly
direction, until he came to one situated upon a branch of the great river.
Journeying for four or five days more, he reached in succession six or
seven other villages similarly situated, until he arrived at one which he was
told was called Quivira.<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> Here he heard of other villages still farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
distant on the banks of a yet larger river called Teucarea. Great was
Coronado’s disappointment at finding that Quivira, instead of being as he
had been informed a city of stone houses of many stories, consisted only of
a collection of straw-built huts, and that its people were the most barbarous
of any that he had hitherto encountered. They ate their meat raw, like the
Querechos and the Teyas, and were clad in tanned bison-skins, not having
any cotton; but they cultivated maize. The Turk, who had for some time
been conducted in chains with the rear-guard, was now interrogated as
to his motives in so misrepresenting the nature of the country, and misleading
the Spaniards. He replied that his own country lay beyond
Quivira, and that the people of Cibola had begged him to lead the
strangers astray upon the plains, so that they might perish by famine,
as it was supposed that they relied upon maize for their food, and did not
know how to chase the bison. One night he endeavored to stir up the
people of Quivira to massacre the Spaniards; but being put upon their
guard, the Spaniards strangled him, to the great delight of Sopete. No
gold or silver was found in the country; but one of the chiefs wore a plate
of copper suspended from his neck, by which he set great store. Coronado
says that Quivira was nine hundred and fifty leagues distant from Mexico,
and was situated in latitude 40°. The soil was rich and black, watered by
many streams, and bore an abundance of grapes and plums.<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> Here he
remained for twenty-five days, sending out exploring parties in all directions,
who found great difficulty in communicating with the natives, owing
to the diversity of languages spoken by them, and the want of interpreters.
It was now the latter part of July,<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> and it was time to start to rejoin the
army at Tiguex. So, after collecting a supply of maize for the journey,
and erecting a cross with an inscription saying that Coronado had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
there, he procured fresh guides, leaving Sopete in his home, and returned
by the route he had come, as far as to the river named for Saints Peter
and Paul. At that point, bending more towards the west, they reached
the country where they had first fallen in with the Querechos, and had been
turned from the direct course by the Turk; and in forty days they reached
Cicuyé.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Arellano and the main portion of the force had been
making preparations for passing the winter at Tiguex, and had been
despatching parties in different directions to procure supplies of provisions.
One under Francisco de Barrio-Nuevo was sent in a northerly direction
up the river and visited two provinces, of which one, called Hemez,
contained seven villages; the other, named Yuque-Yunque, two fine ones
on the bank of the river, and four others strongly fortified and difficult
of access in the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> Twenty leagues farther up the river was a
large and powerful village called Braba, to which the Spaniards gave the
name of Valladolid. It was built on both banks of a deep and rapid stream,
which was crossed by a bridge of well-squared pine timber; and contained
large rooms that could be heated, supported by huge pillars, superior to
anything of the kind that had been seen in the country.<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> Another expedition
was sent down the river, as has been already related.</p>

<p>By this time some apprehension began to be felt for Coronado’s safety,
as the time fixed for his return had expired and nothing had yet been
heard from him. Accordingly Arellano started with a small party in search
of him, and at Cicuyé he was attacked by the inhabitants, with whom he
kept up a contest for four days. Tidings then came from the General;
and, contenting himself with guarding the passes, Arellano waited there
for his arrival. Coronado soon succeeded in re-establishing friendly relations,
and continued on immediately to Tiguex. As soon as he reached
that place he set about in earnest to pacify the whole province, and to
persuade the inhabitants to return to their homes. The most strenuous
exertions were made to procure a supply of clothing for the troops, who
were in great distress for it, and to provide in every way for their comfort;
so that Castañeda says, “Never was Spanish general in the Indies more
beloved or better obeyed than he.” In the spring he promised his men
that they should start again in search of the unknown countries, about
which the Turk had set their imaginations on fire. The greater part were
firm in the conviction that the natives were familiar with gold, despite
their assurances to the contrary, and that they should find it in abundance.
But it is plain from Coronado’s report that he did not share in this belief;
and the sequel proved that others agreed with him. The region of Tiguex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
he found far too cold and too distant from the sea to make it a desirable
situation for a colony.</p>

<p>About this time Tobar arrived with the reinforcements which, as we
have seen, he had been ordered to bring from the valley of Suya. He had
taken only the best soldiers, leaving many discontented and mutinous ones
behind; and these arrived in the full expectation of finding the General
already established in the rich countries about which the marvellous reports
had reached them. But their disappointment was somewhat consoled when
they learned that in the spring the whole army would start in the search
of them. Tobar had brought despatches from the Viceroy, and private
letters,&mdash;among them one informing Cardenas that he had fallen heir to
his elder brother’s estate. Cardenas accordingly obtained leave to return
to Mexico, and several others went with him. Castañeda says that many
more would have been glad to do so, if they had not been restrained by
fear of being accused of cowardice. This shows the divided feeling that
prevailed. And soon trouble arose between the General, who studied only
the welfare of the whole army, and certain of the officers, who selfishly
looked more after the interests of their own men; so that some already
began to talk of abandoning the expedition and returning to New Spain.</p>

<p>When the winter was over, Coronado ordered preparations to be made
to start for Quivira, on the way to the unknown countries. But fate had
ordained a different termination for his enterprise. On a holiday, while
he was amusing himself by tilting at the ring with Maldonado, Coronado’s
saddle-girths broke, and he fell to the ground, where he received a blow on
the head from Maldonado’s horse, which nearly cost him his life. A long
illness followed, during which Cardenas suddenly returned in haste from
Suya, with the news that he had found that post broken up and the inhabitants
massacred. It seems that the discontented element left behind by
Tobar,&mdash;pretending that they had been abandoned, and that the route for
New Spain had left them on one side,&mdash;had deserted Alcarraz and the sick
men under his charge, and had fled to Culiacan. Upon this the natives
became insubordinate, and one night made an attack upon the enfeebled
force with poisoned arrows, killing a number of them. The rest escaped
on foot to Corazones, whose people, always friendly to the Spaniards,
aided them on their way to Culiacan, where they, as well as the mutineers,
were found by Gallegos not long afterward, when he arrived there with
reinforcements.</p>

<p>The news of this calamity was so afflicting to Coronado that he grew
worse, or, as Castañeda intimates, feigned to do so, as he had allowed himself
to give way to the influence of superstitious terrors. In his youth
the prediction had been made that he would become lord of a distant land,
and that he would lose his life there by a fall. This now seemed to him
to be in the way of accomplishment, and he longed to return to die with
his wife and children. The surgeon had kept him informed of the discontent
that prevailed among a portion of his force, and he accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
took secret counsel with certain of the officers, in which it was agreed
that they should persuade their men to present a petition, praying that
they might be allowed to return to New Spain. A council of war was then
held, at which the conclusion was reached that the country was neither
sufficiently rich nor populous to make it worth the holding. Coronado
thereupon issued the necessary orders for the return march. Some of the
officers, however, repented of their decision, and asked the General to give
them sixty picked men, with which to maintain themselves until reinforcements
should be sent by the Viceroy; or for him to take that number
of men for his escort, and leave the command of the expedition to some
other person. But the army would not listen to either of these propositions,
as they had no inclination to make the trial of any new commander. The
consequence was that the zeal and affection of some of the officers for their
chief disappeared, though that of the men still held firm.</p>

<p>It was in the early part of April, 1542, that the army began its return
march to New Spain. Two of the missionaries remained behind, in the
hope of making proselytes of the natives. One of them, a lay brother
named Luis, remained at Cicuyé; the other, Juan de Padilla, who had led
the charge at Tusayan, continued on to Quivira with some native converts;
where, in the words of Castañeda, he speedily “received the martyr’s
crown.” To better insure the safety of the priests, Coronado ordered his
men to set at liberty their native slaves, and then started for Cibola. On
the journey thither the horses, which thus far had kept in excellent
condition, began to die in great numbers. The army accordingly rested
a while there before entering upon the desert lying between that place
and Chichilticalli; and some Christianized Indians from Mexico remained
behind at Cibola, where they were found by Antonio de Espejo, forty-one
years afterward, in 1583.<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a></p>

<p>The crossing of the desert was uneventful, and two days after they
reached Chichilticalli, Gallegos arrived there from the Viceroy with reinforcements
of men and munitions of war. Great was his dismay at finding
the army on its way back, and all the splendid visions dissipated that the
Turk had conjured up. Those of the officers who had offered to remain
and hold the country until the Viceroy’s commands should be received,
now renewed their proposition; but the soldiers refused to return, and
clamored to be led back to New Spain. Coronado found himself powerless
to constrain them, even if he possessed the inclination to do so; nor was
his authority sufficient to enable him to inflict any punishment upon the
deserters who had abandoned Alcarraz at Suya. During the march, Castañeda
says that Coronado kept up the fiction of being ill, and only allowed
his intimates access to his person. The natives, seeing that the country was
being abandoned by the Spaniards, kept up a succession of hostile encounters,
in which several of the force perished. As provisions began to fail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the army hastened on to Petatlan, thirty leagues from Culiacan, the seat
of Coronado’s government. All the bonds of discipline had now become
relaxed, and even his authority there as governor was not sufficient to
reinforce it; but by begging his friends to use their influence with the
men, he was able to bring about one hundred of the force back with
himself to Mexico. Here he was received but coolly by the Viceroy,
Mendoza; his reputation was gone, and soon after he was deprived of his
position as Governor of New Gallicia.</p>

<p>Such was the end of an expedition which, as General Simpson says,
“for extent in distance travelled, duration in time, and the multiplicity
of its co-operating expeditions, equalled, if it did not exceed, any land
expedition that has been undertaken in modern times.”<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a></p>

<h3><a name="c498" id="c498">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE original sources of information in regard to the early Spanish explorations of New
Mexico have been made available for students within the last thirty years by the
publication of several collections of documents, preserved either in Mexico or in the
Archivo de Indias, at Seville, or in the great national repository at Simancas. The first
to appear was the one entitled <i>Documentos para la historia de Mejico</i>, published by order
of the Mexican Government between 1853 and 1857.<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> This is distributed into four series,
of which the third and the fourth contain important historical material bearing upon this
subject. Next came the well-selected <i>Coleccion de varios documentos para la historia de la
Florida y tierras adyacentes</i>, undertaken by the late Buckingham Smith, of which, however,
only the first volume appeared in Madrid, in 1857.<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> Then Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta, the
accomplished translator of Prescott’s <i>Conquest of Peru</i>, published in Mexico a valuable
<i>Coleccion de documentos para la historia de México</i>, in two volumes, the first in 1858 and
the second in 1866.<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> But by far the most important of all is the great <i>Coleccion de documentos
inéditos relativos al descubrimiento, conquista y colonizacion de las posesiones
Españolas en América y Oceanía, sacados en su mayor parte del real Archivo de Indias</i>.
Forty volumes of this indispensable repertory have already appeared at Madrid, between
1864 and 1884, edited by Joaquin Francesco Pacheco and other scholars.<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a> A most essential
service, however, had been rendered to the students of early American history at
a still earlier date by the publication of Henri Ternaux-Compans’ admirable series of
<i>Voyages, relations, et mémoires originaux pour servir à l’histoire de la découverte de
l’Amérique, publiés pour la première fois en Français</i>, of which twenty parts appeared in
Paris between 1837 and 1841.<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> Prior to this our knowledge had been mainly restricted to
Italian translations of original narratives published by Giovanni Battista Ramusio in the
third volume of his <i>Navigationi et Viaggi</i>, Venice, 1556 (reprinted in 1565 and subsequently);
of most of which Richard Hakluyt has given an English version in the third
volume of his <i>Voyages, nauigations, traffiques, and discoueries</i>, London, 1600 (reprinted
in 1810).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>The different expeditions, in their chronological order, may now be studied in the following
original authorities:&mdash;</p>

<p>An account of the expedition of Nuño Beltran de Guzman to Ciguatan is contained in
the <i>Primera</i> (<i>segunda</i>) (<i>tercera</i>) (<i>quarta</i>) <i>relacion anonima de la jornada que hizo
Nuño de Guzman à la Nueva Galicia</i>, in Icazbalceta’s <i>Coleccion</i>, vol. ii. pp. 288-306;
439-483. Other narratives can be found in Pacheco’s <i>Documentos Inéditos</i>, tom. xiv.,
pp. 347-373, and 411-463; tom. xvi., pp. 363-375. De Guzman first conquered and
then colonized Sinaloa, and even penetrated into Sonora, thus preparing the way for the
subsequent explorations. Very little information, however, about New Mexico is to be
obtained from any of these narratives.</p>

<p>Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca published his remarkable story at Zamora in 1542, under
the title: <i>La relacion que dio Aluar Nuñez Cabeça de Vaca de lo acaescido en las Indias
en la armada donde yua por gouernador Páphilo de Narbaez, desde el año de veynte y siete
hasta el año de treynta y seys que boluio a Sevilla con tres de su compañia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> Notwithstanding
the vivid interest that will always attach to this thrilling story of adventure and
suffering, the indications given in it of the routes by which he journeyed, and of the places
and peoples he visited, are practically of far too vague a character to enable them to be
satisfactorily identified,<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> even if we feel warranted in placing implicit confidence in the
author’s veracity.</p>

<p>The original report by Fray Marcos de Nizza (of Nice) of his <i>Descubrimiento de las
Siete Ciudades</i>, can be found in Pacheco’s <i>Documentos inéditos</i>, tom. iii. p. 329; and the
instructions received by him from the Viceroy Mendoza are given on p. 325 of the same
volume. An Italian translation of the report is contained in Ramusio, <i>Navigationi</i>, vol.
iii. p. 356 (ed. of 1565); and from this was made the English version in Hakluyt, <i>Voyages</i>,
vol. iii. p. 438 (ed. of 1810). But on comparing both Ramusio’s and Hakluyt’s versions
with the original, not only will it be found that in many places they are mere paraphrases,
but that frequently additional particulars have been foisted into the text. Especially noticeable
are the many exaggerated statements in regard to the quantities of gold and of precious
stones seen by the monk during his journey, or about which stories are told to him by the
natives, for which there is not a vestige of authority to be found in the original. Fray
Marcos claims to have related what he himself saw or what was told to him; but it is
evident not only that he was prone to lend a credulous ear to whatever fictions might be
imposed upon him, but that he grossly misrepresented what he had himself seen. This
is directly charged upon him by those who followed in his footsteps under Coronado, and
who suffered grievously by reason of his falsifications; so that he was even compelled to
flee to Mexico to escape the consequences of their just indignation. We think that he
fairly deserves the epithet of “the lying monk,” which has been bestowed upon him, in
spite of the air of probability which pervades the greater part of his narrative. But it must
in justice be said, however, that he appears rather to have been carried away by religious
enthusiasm than actuated by any personal or mercenary considerations; and with the hope
of being able to convert the natives to Christianity, he invested them and their surroundings
with the glow of his own imagination. Still, this need not militate against the truth
of his statements in regard to the distances he travelled, or the physical characteristics of
the regions through which his route lay; so that his narrative will always be important for
the students of the topography, if not of the ethnology, of New Mexico at the period of
its discovery.</p>

<p>Ternaux-Compans (<i>Voyages, etc.</i>, vol. ix. p. 256) has made a most faithful French
translation, from copies of the originals at Simancas, of Fray Marcos’s report, and of the
letter from Mendoza to the Emperor Charles V., which accompanied it, as well as of the
instructions received by the Friar from Mendoza.</p>

<p>The story of Coronado’s romantic expedition in search of “The Seven Cities of Cibola”
has been told with more or less of detail by four different persons who took part in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
We have also three of his own letters and despatches narrating his earlier proceedings.
Of these, the first is a brief one, written to the Viceroy Mendoza, dated Culiacan, March 8,
1539, transmitting a report received from Fray Marcos while upon his journey. An
English version of this can be found in Hakluyt, <i>Voyages</i>, vol. iii. p. 434 (ed. of 1810),
translated from Ramusio, <i>Navigationi</i>, vol. iii. p. 395 (ed. of 1565); and a French translation,
in Ternaux-Compans, vol. ix. p. 349. Next comes a short letter to the Viceroy
dated April 10, 1539, in which he tells about the preparations for his ineffectual expedition
to Topira; Hakluyt, p. 352; Ramusio, p. 435; Ternaux-Compans, p. 352. Of much
greater importance, however, is the full report transmitted by him to Mendoza from Cibola
(or Granada, as he called it), August 3, 1540, setting forth everything that had occurred
between that date and April 22, when he had started. An Italian version of this is given
by Ramusio, Navigationi, vol. iii. p. 359 (ed. of 1565); <i>Relatione de Francisco Vazquez de
Coronado del viagio alle dette setta cita</i>. An English translation can be found in Hakluyt,
<i>Voyages</i>, vol. iii. p. 446 (ed. of 1810). Finally, there is the letter which he wrote to the
Emperor Charles V., from Tiguex, after his return from Quivira, in which is related the
course of events from April 23, 1541, up to October 20 of the same year. This can be
found in Pacheco’s <i>Documentos inéditos</i>, tom. iii. p. 363; and it has been repeated in
tom. xiii. p. 261. A French translation of it is given in the <i>Voyages</i> of Ternaux-Compans,
vol. ix. p. 355.</p>

<p>The four narratives by other pens are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. An anonymous <i>Relacion del suceso de la jornada que Francisco Vazquez hizo en el
descubrimiento de Cibola</i>, contained in Buckingham Smith’s <i>Coleccion de varios documentos</i>,
p. 147. This was afterwards printed in Pacheco’s <i>Documentos inéditos</i>, tom. xiv. p. 318,
but with the erroneous date of 1531, instead of 1541.</p>

<p>2. A second anonymous account, entitled <i>Traslado de las nuevas y noticias que dieron
sobre el descobrimiento de una Cibdad que llamaron de Cibola, situada en la Tierra
Nueva</i>, can also be found in <i>Documentos inéditos</i>, tom. xix. p. 529, with the same error
in the date.</p>

<p>3. Of much greater value is the <i>Relacion que dió el Capitan Joan Jaramillo, de la jornada
que hizo à la tierra nueva de la que fué General Francisco Vazquez de Coronado</i>; of
which a French translation was first published by Ternaux-Compans, in his <i>Voyages</i>, etc.,
vol. ix. p. 364. The original was afterwards printed in Buckingham Smith’s <i>Coleccion</i>,
p. 155, and subsequently in Pacheco’s <i>Documentos inéditos</i>, tom. xiv. p. 304, but under
the erroneous date of 1537. It is a straightforward, soldierly narrative, well written, and
with many picturesque details, and it contains an unusual amount of topographical information;
so that it is of great value in establishing the route followed by the expedition,
and in identifying the various localities.</p>

<p>4. But if our knowledge of the expedition had been confined to the authorities thus far
indicated, we should have had a very imperfect idea both of its events and of its results.
In 1838 Ternaux-Compans published a translation into French of a quarto manuscript, of
157 leaves, which he had found in the Uguina Collection, at Paris, under the title <i>Relation
du Voyage de Cibola enterpris in 1540; ou l’on traite de toutes les peuplades qui habitent
cette contrée, de leurs mœurs et coutumes, par Pédro de Castañeda de Nagera</i> (<i>Voyages</i>,
vol. ix. p. 1). Nothing has been discovered in relation to this writer except what is contained
in his own account. He states that he “wrote his narrative in the city of Culiacan,
where he was living in the midst of misery and dangers, as the whole country was in a
state of insurrection” (p. 233). The volume bears the indorsement, “Finished copying
at Seville, Oct. 26, 1596.” As his name is not mentioned in the list of officers which he
has given, it is supposed that he was only a private soldier. The work shows that he was
a man of considerable education, but it is evidently the production of a novice in the art
of literary composition. It is an attempt at a methodical narrative, divided into three
parts, but it is quite difficult to follow in it the order of events. In the first part he treats
of the incidents of the expedition, and of the army and its officers; the second contains a
description of the provinces, villages, and mountains that were discovered, of the religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
and customs of the inhabitants, and of the animals, fruits, and vegetables to be found;
and in the last part he tells about the return of the army, and explains the reasons for
abandoning the attempt at colonization. As he wrote more than twenty years after the
events he has described, he sometimes signifies his inability to remember precisely the
number of miles travelled, or of the days during which they journeyed. He has even fallen
into the error of making the day on which the expedition entered Campostello, Shrove
Tuesday, 1541 (p. 24), although he gives the correct date, 1540, in the <i>Dedicatory Epistle</i>
(p. xiv). Throughout his entire narrative, whenever he gives the date of the year, it is
always one too large, as can be seen on pp. 101, 137, and 213. He professes to have
written for the purpose of correcting the many misrepresentations and fables that had
sprung up in regard to the country they had discovered, and the character of the people,
and the nature of the animals to be found there. Castañeda impresses the reader as a
religious, humane, and candid man, who cannot fail to win his confidence in the truth of
the events he relates. He does not hesitate to expose and to comment upon the cruel
and rapacious acts of his own countrymen; and he does full justice both to the natural
amiability and to the valor of the natives. His various observations show him to have
been a man of sagacity and good judgment. Mr. Bandelier vouches for the remarkable
accuracy of his description of the country, although the distances generally are estimated
one third too great (<i>Historical Introduction to Studies among the Sedentary Indians of
New Mexico</i>, p. 22). The Castañeda MS. is now in the Lenox library.</p>

<p>These are all the original sources of knowledge in regard to the earliest attempts at
exploration in New Mexico by the Spaniards, and especially respecting Coronado’s expedition
to the Seven Cities of Cibola. The historians of Mexico, from Gomara down,
while adding no new information to that detailed by Castañeda, are in agreement with him
as to the general facts.</p>

<p>Renewed attention was directed to Coronado’s expedition and to the probable locality
of Cibola by the publication of the reports contained in the <i>Notes of a Military Reconnoissance
made by Lieut.-Colonel William H. Emory, in 1846-1847, with the advance guard
of the army of the West</i>, during the war between the United States and Mexico,<a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> and the
<i>Report of Lieutenant J. W. Abert of his examination of New Mexico</i>. Colonel Emory,
in a letter to Hon. Albert Gallatin, dated Oct. 8, 1847, made the statement that he had
met with “an Indian race living in four-story houses, built upon rocky promontories,
inaccessible to a savage foe, cultivating the soil, and answering the description of the seven
cities of Coronado, except in their present insignificance in size and population, and the
fact that the towns, though near each other, are not in a (continuous) valley six leagues
long, but on different branches of the same stream” (p. 133). He had in mind the
villages in the vicinity of Ciboletta, Laguna, etc., on the Rio San Jose, a tributary of the
Rio Grande del Norte, about ninety miles east of the present Zuñi pueblo. This opinion
was corroborated by Lieutenant Abert (p. 491). Mr. Gallatin thereupon proceeded
to prepare for the <i>Transactions of the American Ethnological Society</i> (vol. ii. p. liii,
1848) an elaborate essay on the <i>Ancient semi-civilization of New Mexico, Rio Gila, and
its vicinity</i>, in which large use was made of these military reports, and to which was
prefixed a map compiled by Mr. E. G. Squier. In November of the same year Mr.
Squier contributed to the <i>American Review</i> an article on <i>New Mexico and California.
The ancient monuments and the aboriginal semi-civilized nations of New Mexico and
California, with an abstract of the early Spanish explorations and conquests in those
regions, particularly those falling within the territory of the United States</i>. Mr. Gallatin
came to the conclusion that the seven cities “appear to have been near the sources of
a tributary of the great Colorado, and not of the Rio del Norte” (p. lxxii); but he
inclined to the opinion that they had been destroyed by the Apaches (p. xciv). Mr.
Squier identified Cibola with Zuñi; but there are inconsistencies to be found between
his map and statements contained in his article. In that same year Lieutenant J. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
Simpson, in his <i>Journal of a Military Reconnoissance from Santa Fé to the Navajo Country</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a>
gave a detailed description of Zuñi, which he considered to be the site of Cibola.</p>

<p>The explorations carried on in New Mexico and Arizona, from 1853 to 1856, during
the search for a suitable route for the Pacific Railroad, took Lieutenant A. W. Whipple
and Professor W. W. Turner over the same ground, and they both came to a similar
conclusion (<i>Pacific Railroad Reports</i>, vol. iii. pp. 68, 104). But in 1857 Mr. H. M.
Breckenridge published at Pittsburg a brief narrative of the <i>Early discoveries by Spaniards
in New Mexico, containing an account of the castles of Cibola and the present
appearance of their ruins</i>, in which he maintained that Cibola was the well-known ruin
called Casa Grande, on the river Gila. Mr. R. H. Kern, however, upheld the Zuñi
theory in his map, prepared in 1854 to accompany Schoolcraft’s <i>History of the Indian
Tribes of North America</i> (vol. iv. p. 33); and Mr. Schoolcraft himself adopted the same
view (vol. vi. p. 70, 1857).</p>

<p>In the year 1869 important additions were made to our knowledge of the early history
of New Mexico, and especially of Coronado’s expedition. Mr. W. H. H. Davis, who
had held an official position in that Territory, and in 1856 had published an interesting
study of it under the title of <i>El Gringo</i>, gave to the world the first history of <i>The Spanish
Conquest of New Mexico</i>, Doylestown, Penn. In the same year Brevet Brigadier
General Simpson, who had had his attention directed to the question twenty years
previously, prepared for the <i>Annual Report of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
for 1869</i> a thorough study, accompanied by a map, of <i>Coronado’s March in search of the
“Seven Cities of Cibola,” and discussion of their probable location</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> In April of the
same year there appeared in the <i>North American Review</i> an article by the late Mr.
Lewis H. Morgan, entitled <i>The Seven Cities of Cibola</i>, in which that eminent archæologist
made an elaborate argument in favor of the identification of that site with the remarkable
group of ruined stone structures, discovered not long before in the valley of the Rio
Chaco, one of the affluents of the Colorado, about one hundred miles to the northeast
of Zuñi. On this point, however, both Mr. Davis (p. 119) and General Simpson have
pronounced in favor of Zuñi, and General Simpson has even undertaken to answer
Mr. Morgan’s arguments in detail (p. 232). Mr. Morgan, nevertheless, still held to his
opinion in his <i>Study of the houses of the American Aborigines</i>, p. 46 (<i>First annual
report of the Archæological Institute of America</i>, 1880) expanded into the <i>House and
House-life of the American Aborigines</i> (Geographical and Geological Survey of the
Rocky Mountain region, in charge of J. W. Powell, vol. iv., 1881, pp. 167-170).</p>

<p><i>The Spanish Conquest of New Mexico</i>, by Mr. Davis, is a valuable contribution to
history, in which faithful and diligent use has been made of the original authorities and
of unpublished documents; and it is the only full and connected narrative that has yet
appeared of the series of events which it relates. The important episode to which
General Simpson confines his attention is treated in abundant detail, and great acuteness
and local knowledge are displayed in the discussion of the route followed by Coronado.
It is likely to remain always the leading authority upon this subject.</p>

<p>In his elaborate work upon <i>The Native Races of the Pacific States</i>, Mr. H. H.
Bancroft adopted the Zuñi theory as to the site of Cibola (vol. iv. p. 674), repeated
in his <i>History of the Pacific States</i> (vol. x. p. 85).<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> This is also the opinion maintained
by Mr. A. F. Bandelier in his <i>Historical Introduction to Studies among the Sedentary
Indians of New Mexico</i>, p. 12 (<i>Papers of the Archæological Institute of America.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
American series, no. 1, Boston, 1881). This is a very careful and thorough investigation
of the whole subject of the geography of New Mexico and of the tribal relations of
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>At a meeting, however, of the American Antiquarian Society in April, 1881, Rev.
E. E. Hale read a paper entitled <i>Coronado’s Discovery of the Seven Cities</i>, in which he
expressed himself as inclined to abandon his previously maintained opinion<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> in favor of
the Zuñi identification, on account of certain newly discovered evidence set forth in an
accompanying letter from Lieutenant J. G. Bourke, who argued that the Moqui pueblos
better satisfy the conditions of the question. To this the present writer replied in a
communication at the following October meeting of the society, under the title <i>What is
the true site of “The Seven Cities of Cibola” visited by Coronado in 1540?</i> In this all
the different opinions are discussed and the Zuñi theory upheld.</p>

<p>The same view is supported by Mr. L. Bradford Prince, late Chief-Justice of New
Mexico, in his <i>Historical Sketches of New Mexico from the earliest records to the
American occupation</i>, 1883 (p. 115). This modest little volume is the first attempt
yet made to write a continuous history of the Territory down to the year 1847. It is
a useful and in the main a trustworthy compendium. But in the chapter upon Coronado
he has followed Castañeda’s erroneous dates, as Davis also has done before him, and he
has fallen into a few other mistakes.<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a></p>

<p>The alleged expedition of Peñalosa to Quivira
is placed about 1662. The accounts of it
depend on a <i>Relacion del descubrimiento del Pais
y Ciudad de Quivira echo por D. Diego Dionisio
de Peñalosa, escrita por el Padre Fr. Nicolas de
Freytas</i> (1684). In 1882 there were two annotated
renderings of this narrative,&mdash;one by Duro,
mentioned at the beginning of this note, who discredits
the journal and gives other documents on
the same theme; the other, an English version,
was issued under the title, <i>The expedition of Don
Diego Dionisio de Peñalosa, from Santa Fé to the
river Mischipi and Quivira in 1662, as described
by Father Nicholas de Freytas. With an account
of Peñalosa’s projects to aid the French to conquer
the mining country in Northern Mexico; and his
connection with Cavelier de la Salle. By John
Gilmary Shea</i>, New York, 1882.</p>

<p>Dr. Shea in this volume claims that Quivira
was north of the Missouri, while it has generally
been placed south of that river. He also
derives from this narrative an opinion, contrary
to the one ordinarily received, namely, that La
Salle was carried, against his will, beyond the
mouths of the Mississippi in his expedition of
1682; for he judges his over-shooting the mouths
was intentional, in order to land where he could
better co-operate with Peñalosa in wresting the
mines in New Mexico from the Spaniards.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN the Isthmus of Darien was discovered by Vasco Nuñez de
Balbóa, during the six years between 1511 and 1517, there can
be little doubt that tidings, perhaps only in the form of vague rumors,
were received of the greatness and the riches of the Empire of the Yncas.
The speech which the son of the Cacique Comogre is said to have made
to the gold-seeking followers of the discoverer of the South Sea most
probably had reference to Peru; and still more certainly, when the Cacique
of Tumaco told Vasco Nuñez of the country far to the south which
abounded in gold, and moulded the figure of a llama in clay, he gave
tidings of the land of the Yncas. There was a chief in the territory to
the south of the Gulf of San Miguel, on the Pacific coast, named Biru,
and this country was visited by Gaspar de Morales and Francisco Pizarro
in 1515. For the next ten years Biru was the most southern land known
to the Spaniards; and the consequence was that the unknown regions farther
south, including the rumored empire abounding in gold, came to be
designated as <i>Biru</i>, or Peru. It was thus that the land of the Yncas got
the name of Peru from the Spaniards, some years before it was actually
discovered.<a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a></p>

<p>Pedro Arias de Avila, the governor of the mainland called Castilla del
Oro, founded the city of Panamá. He went there from the Pearl Islands,
in the vessels which had been built by his victim Vasco Nuñez, while
Gaspar de Espinosa, the <i>Alcalde Mayor</i>, led the rest of the colony by land.
The city was founded in 1519. The governor divided the land among
four hundred settlers from Darien. Among them were Pascual de Andagoya,
Hernando Luque (a priest), Francisco Pizarro, and Diego de Almagro.
Nombre de Dios, on the Atlantic side of the isthmus, was settled towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
the end of the same year by a captain named Diego Alviles, in obedience
to orders from Pedro Arias.<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1522 Pascual de Andagoya, who had come out to Darien
with Pedro Arias in 1514 and was a cavalier of good family from the
province of Alava, was appointed inspector-general of the Indians on the
isthmus. He made a journey to a district called Chuchama, south of
the Gulf of San Miguel, where the chief told him that a certain people
from a province called Biru, farther south, came to make war upon them
in canoes at every full moon. Andagoya sent to Panamá for reinforcements,
in order to comply with the prayer of the people of Chuchama that
he would defend them, as well as to discover what there was farther south.
Having received an addition to his forces, he set out with the chief of
Chuchama, and in six days arrived at the province called Biru. It had
already been visited by Morales and Pizarro. After capturing their principal
stronghold, several chiefs of Biru made their submission to Andagoya.
From these people he collected information respecting the great empire
of the Yncas, and he then descended a river and continued the examination
of the coast in a small vessel which had followed him from Chuchama.
But he was attacked by a severe illness caused by having been capsized in
a canoe, and then kept for several hours in his wet clothes. He therefore
returned to Panamá, to report the knowledge he had acquired, giving up
his intention of conducting discovery to the southward in person. It was
fully three years before Andagoya had so far recovered as to be able to
ride on horseback.</p>

<p>The governor, Pedro Arias, therefore requested Andagoya to hand over
the enterprise to three partners who formed a company at Panamá. These
were Pizarro, Almagro, and Luque.</p>

<p>Francisco Pizarro was born about the year 1470<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> in the province of Estremadura,
and was the illegitimate son of Gonzalo Pizarro, a soldier who
had served under the Great Captain in Italy. He had arrived at Darien
in the expedition of Alonzo de Ojeda in 1509. During fifteen years he
had been diligently serving as a brave, steady, much-enduring man-at-arms;
and on two or three occasions he found himself in important and
responsible positions. In 1524 he was a citizen of Panamá with very
limited means, but endowed with indomitable energy and perseverance,
and fifty-four years of age. Diego Almagro is said to have been a foundling.
At all events his parentage is unknown. He had probably served
for some years on the isthmus, but his name does not occur until he entered
into this partnership. Almagro is described as a man of short stature, with
a very plain face, and was at least as old as Pizarro. He was hasty in
temper, but generous and warm-hearted, and his fine qualities attracted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
him many faithfully attached adherents. Luque had been schoolmaster
at Darien, and was now the principal parochial clergyman at Panamá, holding
valuable property on the adjacent island of Taboga, and in an influential
position in the colony.</p>

<p>Pizarro was to command the expedition; Almagro was to keep open
communications with Panamá and bring supplies; while Luque acted as
agent, and obtained the needful funds.</p>

<p>One of the small vessels which had been built for Vasco Nuñez was
obtained, and a force of eighty men (one hundred and twelve, according to
Xeres) and four horses was collected. Pizarro prepared to sail with this
single vessel and two canoes, having received all the information and
instructions that Andagoya could give him, and taking with him the interpreters
brought from Biru by that officer. It was arranged that large trees
near the sea-shore should be blazed, as guides to the course taken by
Pizarro, when his partner Almagro should follow with supplies.</p>

<p>Pizarro sailed from Panamá Nov. 14, 1524, and after enduring terrible
sufferings on the coast of Biru, including famine, and losing twenty-seven
of his men, he went back to Chuchama, and sent the treasurer Nicolas de
Ribera to Panamá with the gold which he had collected. Meanwhile
Almagro had followed in another vessel with provisions, and went on the
traces of his companion by means of the trees that had been marked,
until he reached the Rio San Juan in 4° north. Finding no further traces
of Pizarro he returned, having lost an eye in an encounter with natives.
He also lost upwards of seventy men;<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> but he obtained some gold.</p>

<p>After this failure it was more difficult to obtain money and recruits
for a second attempt. Fortunately, the <i>Alcalde Mayor</i>, who was impressed
with the promising character of the undertaking, came forward with the
necessary funds, which he advanced through the agency of Luque. Gaspar
de Espinosa thus became one of the partners. The agreement between
the partners was signed March 10, 1526. Luque signed as the agent
of Espinosa. Pizarro and Almagro could neither read nor write. One
Juan de Pares signed on the part of Pizarro, and Alvaro del Quiro for
Almagro.</p>

<p>The second expedition sailed in 1526. It consisted of two vessels
commanded by Pizarro and Almagro respectively, with a very able and
gallant sailor named Bartolomé Ruiz, of Moguer, as pilot. There were
one hundred and sixty men all told. The adventurers made direct for the
river of San Juan, the farthest point reached by Almagro during the previous
voyage. Here Pizarro landed with his troops. Almagro returned to
Panamá in one vessel, for recruits and provisions, while Ruiz proceeded on
a voyage of discovery to the southward in the other.</p>

<p>Ruiz made a remarkable voyage, having rounded Cape Passado and
reached 1° south. He was thus the first European to cross the equator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
on the southern passage. He also fell in with a raft under sail, which belonged
to Tumbez in Peru, and thus obtained several curious specimens
of Ynca art, and some
additional information.
Almagro made
a prosperous voyage
back to Panamá, and
returned with supplies.</p>

<p>Pizarro had been
left on a forest-covered,
fever-haunted
coast, which has
changed very little
from that day to this.
Hoping to find a better
country inland,
he undertook long
marches through the
tangled forest; but
many of his men perished,
and his party
returned to the coast, suffering from disease and famine. In this sorry
plight the all-enduring Pizarro was found, when Almagro and Ruiz
returned.</p>

<p>Almagro had found a new governor installed at Panamá. Pedro de
los Rios had superseded Pedro Arias, who was transferred to Nicaragua,
where he died in 1532. With the new governor’s sanction, about eighty recruits
were collected, and with these and a fresh supply of stores Almagro
returned to the Rio de San Juan.</p>

<p>The two partners then embarked, and under the guidance of the pilot
Ruiz they advanced along the coast as far as Atacames. They were now
in the province of Quito, a part of the Ynca empire. Here were large
towns, much ground under cultivation, and a formidable array of well-armed
troops to oppose their depredations. It was evident that the
Spanish force was too weak to make a successful settlement. Pizarro
proposed a return; Almagro opposed him, and there was a violent quarrel,
which was outwardly reconciled, leaving a permanent feeling of suppressed
jealousy and ill-will on both sides. Finally it was resolved that Pizarro and
part of the force should remain on the island of Gallo, which had been discovered
by Ruiz in 1° 57´ north, while Almagro should return once more for
recruits. The arrangements caused much discontent. The men complained
that they were being left to starve. Some wrote letters home to Panamá,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
full of complaints, which were seized by Almagro. One, however, named
Saravia, concealed a note in a large ball of cotton sent as a present to the
governor’s wife. It contained
the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp2q p1">
“Pues Señor Gobernador,<br />
Mírelo bien por entero,<br />
Que allá va el recogedor,<br />
Y acá queda el carnicero.”<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Pizarro, soon after
Almagro’s departure,
sent off the other ship
with the most mutinous
of his followers. But
the governor, Los Rios,
was much incensed at
the result of the expedition.
He refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
give any further countenance to the enterprise, and sent two vessels, under
the command of Don Pedro Tafur, of Cordova, to Gallo, with orders to take
every Spaniard off the island and bring them back to Panamá. Meanwhile
Pizarro and his people were suffering from famine and disease, and from the
incessant rains. Nearly all had lost every feeling of desire for hazardous
adventures. They longed only to be relieved from their sufferings, and
hailed the arrival of Tafur with unconcealed joy.</p>

<p>Then it was that Pizarro displayed that heroic resolution which has made
the famous act of himself and his sixteen companions immortal. The story
is differently told. Herrera says that Tafur stationed himself in one part of
the vessel, and drawing a line, placed Pizarro and his soldiers on the other
side of it. He then told those who wished to return to Panamá to come
over to him, and those who would remain, to stay on Pizarro’s side of the
line. But Garcilasso de la Vega tells us that when Pizarro saw his men
electing to return in the ship, he drew his sword and made a long line with
the point along the sand. Then, turning to his men, he said, “Gentlemen!
This line signifies labor, hunger, thirst, fatigue, wounds, sickness, and every
other kind of danger that must be encountered in this conquest until life is
ended. Let those who have the courage to meet and overcome the dangers
of this heroic achievement cross the line, in token of their resolution, and as
a testimony that they will be my faithful companions. And let those who
feel unworthy, return to Panamá; for I do not wish to put force upon any
man. I trust in God that, for his greater honor and glory, his Eternal
Majesty will help those who remain with me, though they be few, and
that we shall not miss those who forsake us.” Of the two accounts, that of
Garcilasso is probably nearer the truth, because it is unlikely that the
embarkation would have taken place before the election was made. It
would naturally be made on the beach, before going on board. Most of
the authorities give the number of those who crossed the line at thirteen.
Xeres, Pizarro’s secretary, says there were sixteen. Herrera gives the names
of thirteen heroic men, Garcilasso supplying the remaining three; and they
deserve to be held in memory.<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing could shake the resolution of Pizarro. He would not return
until he had achieved greatness, and he found sixteen good men and true
to stand by him in his great need. They removed from Gallo to the island
of Gorgona, where there was some game and better water; while the others
returned with Tafur to Panamá.</p>

<p>The governor looked upon Pizarro’s conduct as an act of madness, and
refused all succor; but at length yielding to the entreaties of Luque and
Almagro, he allowed one vessel to be sent to Gorgona, with strict orders
to return in six months. So a small vessel was fitted out under the command
of the pilot Ruiz, and after seven weary months the little forlorn
hope at Gorgona descried the white sail, and joyfully welcomed their friends
with a supply of food and stores. Full of hope, Pizarro and his gallant
friends embarked; and the expert Ruiz, guided by information obtained
from the Peruvian sailors on the raft, made direct for the Gulf of Guayaquil,
performing the voyage in twenty days. The year 1527 was now well
advanced. Anchoring off the island of Santa Clara, they stood across to
the town of Tumbez on the following day. Here they saw the undoubted
signs of a great civilization, betokening the existence of a powerful empire.
Their impressions were confirmed by a subsequent cruise along the Peruvian
coast as far as Santa, in 9° south latitude. They learned enough to justify
a return to Panamá with the report of a great discovery, the importance of
which would justify an application to the Spanish Government for some
valuable concession to Pizarro and his partners. Pizarro took with him,
from Tumbez, a lad who was to act as interpreter,&mdash;called Felipillo by
the Spaniards,&mdash;and also a few llamas. He then made the best of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
way back to Panamá; and it was agreed that he should proceed to Spain
and make a direct application to the Crown for authority to undertake the
conquest of the empire of the Yncas. In the spring of 1528, after having
collected the necessary funds with much difficulty, Pizarro set out for Spain,
accompanied by Pedro de Candia. Luque and Almagro waited at Panamá
for the result.</p>

<p>Francisco Pizarro was well received by the Emperor Charles V. in an
interview at Toledo; but the sovereign set out for Italy immediately
afterwards, and subsequent arrangements were made with the Government
of the queen-mother. The capitulation was signed on the 26th
of July, 1529. Pizarro was appointed captain-general and <i>adelantado</i>, and
was decorated with the order of Santiago. He was also granted a coat-of-arms,
and thirteen out of the sixteen who crossed the line at Gallo
were ennobled by name. Almagro was made governor of Tumbez, and
afterwards received the title of marshal. Luque was to be bishop of
Tumbez, and protector of the Indians. Ruiz received the title of grand
pilot of the South Sea. Candia was appointed commander of the artillery.
Pizarro visited Estremadura, and from his home took back with
him to Peru his
four brothers. Hernando,
the eldest
and only legitimate
son of his
father, was a big
tall man, with thick
lips and very red
nose, brave and
proud, with an uncompromising
temper,
and ruthlessly
cruel. Juan and
Gonzalo were illegitimate,
like Francisco,
and Francisco
Martin de
Alcantara was a uterine brother. His young cousin Pedro Pizarro, the
future historian, then only fifteen, went out as the conqueror’s page; Fray
Vicente de Valverde, a fanatical Dominican, also went out; and Pizarro
set sail from San Lucar on the 19th of January, 1530. On arriving at
Panamá, he was upbraided by Almagro for not having attended fairly
to his (Almagro’s) interests, while careful to secure everything for himself.
From that time the old partners were never really friends, and there was
ill-concealed enmity between Almagro and Hernando Pizarro. Meanwhile
preparations for the expedition were busily proceeded with at Panamá;
and, as on former occasions, Almagro was to follow with supplies and reinforcements.</p>

<p>Pizarro sailed from Panamá on the 28th of December, 1531, with three
small vessels carrying one hundred and eighty-three men and thirty-seven
horses. In thirteen days he arrived at the bay of San Mateo, where he
landed the horses and soldiers to march along the shore, sending back the
ships to get more men and horses at Panamá and Nicaragua. They returned
with twenty-six horses and thirty more men. With this force Pizarro
continued his march along the sea-coast, which was well peopled; and on
arriving at the bay of
Guayaquil, he crossed
over in the ships to
the island of Puna.
Here a devastating
war was waged with
the unfortunate natives,
and from Puna
the conqueror proceeded
again in his
ships to the Peruvian
town of Tumbez. The
country was in a state
of confusion, owing to
a long and desolating
war of succession between
Huascar and
Atahualpa, the two
sons of the great Ynca
Huayna Capac, and
was thus an easy prey to the invaders. Huascar had been defeated and
made prisoner by the generals of his brother, and Atahualpa was on his
way from Quito to Cusco, the capital of the empire, to enjoy the fruits of
his victory. He was reported to be at Caxamarca, on the eastern side
of the mountains; and Pizarro, with his small force, set out from Tumbez
on the 18th of May, 1532.</p>

<p>The coast of Peru is a rainless region of desert, crossed at intervals by
fertile valleys which follow the courses of the streams from the Andes to the
sea. Parallel with this coast region, to the eastward, is the <i>sierra</i>, or mountainous
country of the <i>cordilleras</i> of the Andes, the cradle and centre of the
civilized tribes of Peru. Still farther to the eastward are the great rivers
and vast forests or <i>montaña</i> of the basin of the Amazons.<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a> Thus the length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>

<p>The first part of Pizarro’s march was southward from Tumbez, in the
rainless coast region. After crossing a vast desert he came to Tangarara,
in the fertile valleys of the Chira, where he founded the city of San Miguel,
the site of which was afterwards removed to the valley of Piura. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
accountant Antonio Navarro and the royal treasurer Riquelme were left
in command at San Miguel, and Pizarro resumed his march in search of the
Ynca Atahualpa on the 24th of September, 1532. He detached the gallant
cavalier, Hernando de Soto, into the <i>sierra</i> of Huancabamba, to reconnoitre,
and pacify the country. De Soto rejoined the main body after an
absence of about ten days. The brother of Atahualpa, named Titu
Atauchi, arrived as an envoy,
with presents, and a
message to the effect that
the Ynca desired friendship
with the strangers.</p>

<p>Crossing the vast desert
of Sechura, Pizarro
reached the fertile valley
of Motupe, and marched
thence to the foot of the
<i>cordilleras</i> in the valley of
the Jequetepeque. Here
he rested for a day or two,
to arrange the order for
the ascent. He took with
him forty horses and sixty
foot, instructing Hernando
de Soto to follow him
with the main body and
the baggage. News arrived
that the Ynca Atahualpa
had reached the
neighborhood of Caxamarca
about three days
before, and that he desired peace. Pizarro pressed forward, crossed the
<i>cordillera</i>, and on Friday, the 15th of November, 1532, he entered Caxamarca
with his whole force. Here he found excellent accommodation in
the large masonry buildings, and was well satisfied with the strategic position.
Atahualpa was established in a large camp outside, where Hernando
de Soto had an interview with him. Atahualpa announced his intention
of visiting the Christian commander, and Pizarro arranged and perpetrated
a black act of treachery. He kept all his men under arms. The Ynca,
suspecting nothing, came into the great square, walking in grand regal
procession. He was suddenly attacked and made prisoner, and his people
were massacred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ynca offered a ransom, which he described as gold enough to fill a
room twenty-two feet long and seventeen wide, to a height equal to a man’s
stature and a half. He undertook to do this in two months, and sent
orders for the collection of golden vases and ornaments in all parts of the
empire.<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> Soon the treasure began to arrive, while Atahualpa was deceived
by false promises; and he beguiled his captivity by acquiring Spanish and
learning to play at chess and cards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pizarro sent an expedition under his brother Hernando, to
visit the famous temple of Pachacamac on the coast; and three soldiers
were also despatched to Cusco, the capital of the empire, to hurry forward
the treasure. They set out in February, 1533, but behaved with so
much imprudence and insolence at Cusco as to endanger their own lives
and the success of their mission. Pizarro therefore ordered two officers
of distinction, Hernando de Soto and Pedro del Barco, to follow them and
remedy the mischief which they were doing. On Easter eve, being the
14th of April, 1533, Almagro arrived at Caxamarca with a reinforcement
of one hundred and fifty Spaniards and eighty-four horses.</p>

<p>On the 3d of May it was ordered that the gold already arrived should be
melted down for distribution; but another large instalment came on the
14th of June. An immense quantity consisted of slabs, with holes at the
corners, which had been torn off the walls of temples and palaces; and
there were vessels and ornaments of all shapes and sizes. After the royal
fifth had been deducted, the rest was divided among the conquerors. The
total sum of 4,605,670 ducats would be equal to about £3,500,000 of modern
money.<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> After the partition of the treasure, the murder of the Ynca was
seriously proposed as a measure of good policy. The crime was committed
by order of Pizarro, and with the concurrence of Almagro and the friar
Valverde.<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> It was expected that the sovereign’s death would be followed
by the dispersion of his army, and the submission of the people. This
judicial murder was committed in the square of Caxamarca on the 29th
of August, 1533. Hernando de Soto was absent at the time, and on his
return he expressed the warmest indignation. Several other honorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
cavaliers protested against the execution. Their names are even more
worthy of being remembered than those of the heroic sixteen who crossed

<p>Pizarro at first set up a son of Atahualpa as his successor; but the boy
died within two months. A more important matter was the despatch of the
treasure to Spain, with tidings of the conquest. The first ship, laden with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
Peruvian gold, arrived at Seville on the 5th of December, 1534. The second
ship followed in January, having on board, besides the treasure, Hernando
Pizarro, the conqueror’s brother. The excitement caused by these arrivals
was intense; and there was an eager desire among adventurers, both of high
and low degree, to become settlers in this land of promise.</p>

<p>In September Pizarro began his march from Caxamarca to Cusco, the
capital of the empire, with five hundred Spaniards and about one hundred
and fifty horses. The artilleryman Candia had charge of two falconets.
The march was along the lofty valleys and over the passes of the <i>sierra</i>,
by Huamachuco, Huánuco, Xauxa, and Huamanga. The rear-guard was
attacked by Titu Atauchi, brother of Atahualpa, with six thousand men;
and eight Spaniards were taken prisoners, among them Francisco de Chaves
and Hernando de Haro, who had protested against the murder of the Ynca
Atahualpa, and Sancho de Cuellar, who had been clerk to the court at the
mock trial. They were taken to Caxamarca, which had been abandoned
by the Spaniards. Chaves and Haro were treated with the greatest kindness.
Cuellar was strangled on the spot where Atahualpa was put to death.
Hernando de Soto and Almagro led the van of the Spanish army, and
they had to fight a well-contested battle beyond the Apurimac, with a native
army led by one of the generals of Atahualpa. Leaving a garrison at Xauxa,
Pizarro followed more leisurely; and on forming a junction with Almagro
on the great plain of Sacsahuana, near Cusco, he perpetrated another
great crime. Challcuchima, one of Atahualpa’s ablest generals, who had
been taken prisoner, was burned alive. Soon afterward the Ynca Manco,
son of Huayna Capac, and the rightful heir to the sovereignty, arrived at
the Spanish camp to make his submission and claim protection. His rights
were recognized; and on the 15th of November, 1533, the conqueror
Pizarro entered the city of Cusco in company with the rightful sovereign.
The Ynca Manco was inaugurated with the usual ceremonies and rejoicings;
but in March, 1534, his beloved city of Cusco was converted into a
Spanish town, and a municipality was established. The palaces and spacious
halls were appropriated as churches and private houses of the conquerors.
The Dominicans received the great Temple of the Sun as their
monastery; and Friar Valverde, who became the first bishop of Cusco, in
1538, took the spacious palace of the Ynca Uira-ccocha, in the great
square, for his cathedral.</p>

<p>It was not long before the fame of the riches of Peru brought more
conquerors to seek for a share of the spoils. In March, 1534, Pedro de
Alvarado, one of the conquerors of Mexico, landed at Puerto Viejo, close
to the equator, with five hundred Spaniards, half of whom were mounted.
Among them was the noble cavalier Garcilasso de la Vega, father of the
future historian. After suffering dreadful hardships in passing through the
forests of the coast, the adventurers reached Riobamba, with a loss of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
fourth of their number. Pizarro, leaving a garrison of ninety men under
his brother Juan at Cusco, proceeded to the sea-coast, where he had an interview
with Alvarado at Pachacamac. It was agreed that Alvarado should
return to his government of Guatemala, while many of his surviving followers
attached themselves to the fortunes of Pizarro.</p>

<p>The conqueror now resolved to fix the principal seat of his government
within a short distance of some convenient seaport. He finally selected
a site in the valley of the Rimac, six miles from the shores of the Pacific
Ocean. Here Pizarro founded the city of Lima on the festival of Epiphany,
the 6th of January, 1535. It was called “Ciudad de los Reyes” (the city
of the kings) in honor of Charles V. and his mother Juana, and also in
memory of the day.
The city was laid out on
a regular plan, which has
been little altered down
to the present time, with
broad streets, at right angles,
and a spacious square
near the centre, one side
of which was to be occupied
by the cathedral and
another by the palace.
Pizarro appointed municipal
officers, collected laborers,
and with great
energy pushed on the
work of building.</p>

<p>Hernando Pizarro, arriving with such welcome treasure, was very graciously
received in Spain. Charles V. confirmed all his brother’s previous
grants, and created him a marquis;<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> while Almagro, with the title of
marshal, was empowered to discover and occupy territory for two hundred
leagues, beginning from the southern boundary of Pizarro’s government.
Hernando himself was created a knight of Santiago, and was authorized
to enlist recruits, and equip a fleet for his return to Peru. The return of
Hernando was the signal for the breaking out of a feud between the old
partners. Almagro and his friends declared that Cusco itself was to the
south of the boundary assigned to the territory of Pizarro. The conqueror
hurried from his work of building at Lima to Cusco, and made a solemn
reconciliation with Almagro, by a written agreement dated June 12, 1535.</p>

<p>Almagro was induced to undertake an expedition for the discovery and
conquest of Chili. He was accompanied by a large army of Indians, led
by two Yncas of the blood royal; and he had with him about two hundred
Spaniards. He set out from Cusco in the autumn. Pizarro then returned
to the coast, to push forward the building of Lima, and to found the cities
of Truxillo (1535), Chachapoyas (1536), Huamanga (1539), and Arequipa
(1540). Hernando Pizarro, on his return, was sent to join his brothers Juan
and Gonzalo at Cusco, and to take command of that city and fortress.</p>

<p>The Spaniards had already begun to look upon the natives as their
slaves, and the young Ynca Manco was not only treated with neglect, but
exposed to every kind of humiliating insult. He escaped from Cusco, and
put himself at the head of a great army of his subjects in the valley of
Yucay. This was a signal; and immediately
the whole country was in revolt
against the invaders. Juan Pizarro was
driven back into Cusco, and the city
was closely besieged by the armies of the
Ynca from February, 1536. The besiegers
succeeded in setting the thatched
roofs of the halls and palaces on fire, and
the Spanish garrison was reduced to the
greatest straits. The Yncas had occupied
the fortress which commands the town,
and Juan Pizarro was killed in an attempt
to carry it by storm. Finally Hernando
Pizarro himself captured the fortress, after
a heroic defence by the Ynca garrison.
Still the close siege of the city continued,
and the garrison was reduced to the last
straits by famine. Month after month
passed away without tidings. At last the
season for planting arrived, and in August
the Ynca was obliged to raise the siege.</p>

<p class="p2">Chili, the long strip of land along the
west coast of South America, to the south
of Peru, had been conquered by the
Yncas as far as the river Maule. Beyond
that limit were the indomitable tribes of
Araucanian Indians. Bounded on one
side by the <i>cordillera</i> of the Andes, and
on the other by the sea, the country enjoys
a temperate climate, suited for the
cultivation of wheat and the rearing of
cattle. It can be approached from Peru
either by traversing the great desert of
Atacama on the coast, or by marching
over the snowy plateaus and rocky passes
of the Andes. Almagro chose the latter
route. The Indian auxiliaries, led by
Paullu, the brother of Ynca Manco, and
by the Uillac Umu, or high-priest, marched first, carrying provisions and
making arrangements for their supply, taking the road through the Collao<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
and Charcas (the modern republic of Bolivia). The Indian contingent
was followed by one hundred Spaniards under Don Juan Saavedra; and
this advanced party waited at Paria, in the south of Charcas, for the main
body. This was commanded by Don Rodrigo Orgoñez, a native of Oropesa,
who had served under the constable Bourbon at the sack of Rome.
He was a brave and experienced commander, ever faithful to his chief,
the marshal Almagro. The whole force, when united in the distant valley
of Jujuy, consisted of five hundred Spaniards, with two hundred horses.
The march across the Andes to Coquimbo, in Chili, during the winter of
1536, was a time of intense suffering and hardship bravely endured; but
it was stained by the most revolting cruelties to the people of Charcas
and Jujuy.</p>

<p>Almagro advanced from Coquimbo to the southward, and his Peruvian
contingent suffered a defeat from an army of Promauca Indians. He was
reinforced by Orgoñez and Juan Rada, another faithful adherent, who
brought with them the royal order appointing Almagro to be <i>adelantado</i>,
or governor, of New Toledo, which was to extend two hundred leagues from
the southern limit of Pizarro’s government of New Castile. The explorers
now desired to return and occupy this new government, which they claimed
to include the city of Cusco itself. Almagro had arranged that three small
vessels should sail from Callao, the port of Lima, for the Chilian coast, with
provisions. Only one ever sailed, named the “Santiaguillo,” having a cargo
of food, clothing, and horse-shoes. She arrived in a port on the coast
of Chili; and when the tidings reached Almagro, he sent the gallant Juan
de Saavedra, the leader of his vanguard, with thirty horsemen, to communicate
with her. Saavedra found the little vessel anchored in a bay surrounded
by rugged hills covered with an undergrowth of shrubs, and having
a distant view of the snowy <i>cordillera</i>. In some way it reminded him of
his distant Spanish home. Saavedra was a native of the village of Valparaiso,
near Cuenca, in Castile. He named the bay, where the principal
seaport of Chili was destined to be established, Valparaiso. This was in
September, 1536. Landing the much-needed supplies, Saavedra rejoined
his chief, and the expedition of Almagro began its painful return journey
by the desert of Atacama. On arriving at Arequipa, Almagro first heard
of the great insurrection of the Yncas. Marching rapidly to Cusco, his
lieutenant, Orgoñez, defeated the Ynca Manco in the valley of Yucay; and
Almagro entered the ancient city, claiming to be its lawful governor.</p>

<p>The royal grant had given Pizarro all the territory for two hundred and
seventy leagues southward from the river of Santiago, in 1° 20´ north, and
to Almagro two hundred leagues extending from Pizarro’s southern limit.
Herrera says that there were seventeen and one half leagues in a degree.
This would bring Pizarro’s boundary as far south as 14° 50´, and would
leave Cusco (13° 30´ 55″ south) well within it. But neither the latitudes of
the river Santiago nor of Cusco had been fixed, and the question was open
to dispute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>

<p>Almagro seized upon Cusco on the 8th of April, 1537, and placed the
brothers Hernando and Gonzalo Pizarro, who had defended the place
against the Yncas, in confinement. News then came that a large body of
men under Alonzo de Alvarado, sent by the governor Pizarro from Lima,
was approaching Cusco. Alvarado, with about five hundred men, had
advanced as far as the river Abancay, where he was surprised and defeated
by Orgoñez on the 12th of July, 1537. Meanwhile some reinforcements
were arriving at Lima, in reply to the appeals of Pizarro for help against
the native insurrection.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastic Luque had died; but the other partner who advanced
the money for the original expedition, the licentiate Gaspar de Espinosa,
still lived; and he now joined Pizarro at Lima, with a force of two hundred
and fifty men. Cortés also despatched a vessel with supplies and military
stores from Mexico.</p>

<p>The Marquis&mdash;as Pizarro was now styled&mdash;sent an embassy to Almagro
at Cusco, under the licentiate Espinosa, in the hope of settling the
dispute amicably. Almagro, elated by his successes, was in no mood for
moderating his demands; and, unfortunately, Espinosa died very suddenly
in the midst of the negotiation. It was broken off; and Almagro declared
his intention of retaining Cusco and marching to the coast, in order to
establish for himself a seaport. Orgoñez had again defeated the Ynca
Manco, dispersed his army, and forced him to take refuge, with his family
and little court, in the mountainous fastness of Vilcabamba. Leaving
Gonzalo Pizarro in prison at Cusco, Almagro marched to the valley of
Chincha, on the sea-coast, taking Hernando Pizarro with him. At Chincha
he began to lay out a city, to be called Almagro, which was to rival
Lima, one hundred miles to the northward. Chincha is nearly in the
same latitude as Cusco.</p>

<p>While he was at Chincha, Almagro received news that Gonzalo Pizarro
and Alonzo de Alvarado had escaped from their Cusco prison, and reached
the camp of the marquis, near Lima. After some correspondence, it was
agreed that a friar named Francisco de Bobadilla should arbitrate, and that
Pizarro and Almagro should have a personal interview in the little town of
Mala, near the coast, between Lima and Chincha. The meeting took place
on the 13th of November, 1537. There was a furious altercation. They
parted in anger; indeed Almagro, fearing treachery, rode off very hastily.
A cavalier of Pizarro’s party had hummed two lines of an old song in his
hearing,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Tiempo es el cavallero,<br />
Tiempo es de andar de aqui.”</p>

<p class="p1">It was the last time the old partners ever saw each other. The friar’s
award was that a skilful pilot should be sent to fix the latitude of the river
of Santiago, and that meanwhile Almagro should deliver up Cusco, and
Hernando Pizarro should be set at liberty. But in order to secure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
safety of his brother, the marquis made the concession that Almagro should
hold Cusco until the boundaries were fixed. Hernando was then allowed
to leave the camp of Almagro.</p>

<p>But the marquis had no intention of allowing his rival to retain Cusco.
Too old to take the field himself, he intrusted the command of his army to
his brother Hernando. His rival was also broken down by age and infirmities,
and Rodrigo de Orgoñez became the actual commander of Almagro’s
forces. He retreated by short marches towards Cusco, the old marshal
being carried in a litter, and requiring long intervals of rest. The marquis
led his army down the coast to Yca, where he took leave of it, and returned
to Lima. His brother Hernando then proceeded still farther along
the coast to Nasca, and ascended the <i>cordilleras</i> by way of Lucanas, reaching
the neighborhood of Cusco in April, 1538. Almagro had arrived at
Cusco ten days before.</p>

<p>Orgoñez took up a position at a place called Salinas, about three
miles from Cusco, with a force of five hundred men and about two
hundred horses. His artillery consisted of six falconets, which, with the
cavalry, he stationed on the flanks of his infantry. On Saturday, the 26th
of April, 1538 (or the 6th, the day of Saint Lazarus, according to Garcilasso),
Hernando Pizarro began the attack. The infantry was led by his
brother Gonzalo, and by Pedro de Valdivia, the future governor of Chili.
Crowds of Indians watched the battle, and rejoiced to see their oppressors
destroying one another. The cavalry charged at full gallop, the infantry
fought desperately; but Orgoñez was killed, and after an hour the fortune
of the day turned against the marshal. His soldiers fled to Cusco, followed
by the victorious party, and Almagro himself was put in chains and confined
in the same prison where he had put the Pizarros. His young son
Diego,&mdash;by an Indian girl of Panamá,&mdash;to whom the old man was devotedly
attached, was sent at once to the camp of the marquis at Lima, in charge
of Alcantara, the half-brother of the Pizarros. Hernando then prepared a
long string of accusations against his defeated foe, obtained his condemnation,
and caused him to be garroted in the prison. Almagro was buried
in the church of La Merced at Cusco, in July, 1538.</p>

<p>The Marquis Francisco Pizarro received the young Almagro with kindness,
and sent him to Lima, ordering him to be treated as his son. The
governor himself remained for some time at Xauxa, and then proceeded
to Cusco, where he confiscated the property of Almagro’s followers. He
sent his brother Gonzalo to conquer the people of Charcas. In 1539 Hernando
Pizarro set out for Spain; but the friends of Almagro were before him.
He was coldly received, and eventually committed to prison for his conduct
at Cusco, and lingered in captivity for upwards of twenty years.</p>

<p>Pizarro returned to Lima, and despatched numerous expeditions in
various directions for discovery and conquest. Gomez de Alvarado was
intrusted with the settlement of Huánuco; Francisco de Chaves, of Conchucos;
Vergara and Mercadillo were to explore Bracamoras and Chachapoyas;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
and Pedro de Candia was to settle the Collao. Gonzalo Pizarro
himself undertook an expedition to the land of cinnamon,&mdash;the forest-covered
region to the eastward of Quito. Leaving Pedro de Puelles in
command at Quito, Gonzalo entered the forests with three hundred and
fifty Spaniards and four thousand Indians on Christmas Day, 1539. The
hardships and sufferings of these dauntless explorers have seldom been
equalled by any body of men on record. Descending the rivers Coca and
Napo, Gonzalo intrusted the command of a small vessel to Francisco de
Orellana to go on in advance and seek for supplies. But Orellana deserted
his starving comrades, discovered the whole course of the river Amazon,
and returned to Spain. Out of the three hundred and fifty Spaniards that
started, fifty deserted with Orellana, two hundred and ten died of hunger
and disease, and the miserable remnant eventually returned to Quito with
their intrepid leader, Gonzalo Pizarro, in June, 1542.</p>

<p>The marquis had also resolved to renew the attempt to conquer Chili,
which had been abandoned by Almagro. A cavalier had actually been
sent out from Spain, named Pedro Sanchez de Hoz, to undertake this
service. The marquis associated with him a commander on whose judgment,
resolution, and fidelity he could better rely. Pedro de Valdivia was
a native of Serena in Estremadura. He had seen much service in Italy;
was at the taking of Milan and at the battle of Pavia. He had arrived in
Peru in 1535, having been sent from Mexico by Hernando Cortés when
the governor of Peru appealed for help to resist the Ynca revolt. He did
important service for the Pizarros at the battle of Salinas.</p>

<p>Having collected one hundred and fifty soldiers at Cusco, Valdivia
began his march for Chili in March, 1540. His camp-master was Pedro
Gomez; his standard-bearer, Pedro de Mayor; his chief of the staff,
Alonso Monroy. Francisco de Aguirre and Jeronimo de Alderete were
his captains of cavalry; Francisco de Villagran led the arquebusiers, and
Rodrigo de Quiroga the pikemen. Two priests, named Bartolomé Rodrigo
and Gonzalo Marmolejo, accompanied the expedition. Before starting,
Valdivia went to the cathedral of Cusco, and swore, in presence of
Bishop Valverde, that the first church he built should be dedicated to
Our Lady of the Assumption, the patroness of Cusco, and that the first
city he founded should be named Santiago, after the patron of Spain. Valdivia
marched by way of the desert of Atacama, and at the very outset
he made an agreement with Sanchez de Hoz that the sole command should
rest with himself.</p>

<p>Valdivia had for a guide the friar Antonio Rondon, who had accompanied
Almagro’s expedition; and with his aid he overcame all the difficulties
of the march, and safely reached Copiapo in Chili. Advancing
by Huasco and Coquimbo, he defeated a large army of natives in the
valley of Chili or Aconcagua, and eventually selected a site for the foundation
of a new city on the banks of the river Mapocho, in the territory
of the Cacique Huelen-Guala. The foundation of the church, dedicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
to the Assumption, in accordance with the vow made at Cusco, was laid
on the 12th of February, 1541. The plan of the city was laid out, and it
received the name of Santiago. The officers of the municipality were
elected on the 7th of March, to remain in office for one year.</p>

<p>It was not long before the natives of Chili took up arms to oppose the
intruders. Valdivia marched against a large body, leaving Monroy in
command at Santiago. But another force of Indians attacked the city
itself, with desperate valor, during fifteen days, killing four Spaniards and
twenty-three horses, and setting fire to the houses. Valdivia hastily
returned; and although the whole country was in insurrection, Monroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
nobly volunteered to make his way to Peru and return with reinforcements
and supplies. He set out Jan. 28, 1542. Valdivia began to cultivate the
land near Santiago, and to sow wheat, in the hope of raising crops; and
on the hill of Santa Lucia he constructed a fort where provisions and valuables
could be stored. But the little colony continued to suffer much from
scarcity of provisions. Monroy, hiding in the woods during the day and
travelling at night, escaped from Chili and reached Cusco in safety. He
succeeded in getting a small vessel sent from the port of Arequipa to Valparaiso,
while he himself returned by the desert of Atacama, reaching Santiago
in December, 1543. Valdivia was now able to assume the offensive, and the
armed Indians retired to a distance from Santiago.</p>

<p>The chief pilot of Panamá, an experienced Genoese seaman named Juan
Bautista Pastene, with Juan Calderon de la Barca, was ordered to undertake
a voyage of discovery along the coast of Chili at about the same
time. He sailed from Callao in July, 1544, and arrived at the port of
Valparaiso in August, in his little vessel the “San Pablo.”</p>

</div></div>

<p>Here he was visited by Valdivia, who confirmed the name of Valparaiso and officially
declared it to be the port of Santiago. Valdivia proclaimed the foundation
of the town of Valparaiso on the 3d of September, 1544, and appointed
Pastene his lieutenant in command of the Chilian seas. The two little
vessels “San Pedro” and “Santiaguillo” then took some men-at-arms
on board, and proceeded on a voyage of discovery to the southward on
the 4th of September. Pastene went as far as 41° south, discovering a
harbor which was named Valdivia, the mouths of several rivers, the island
of Mocha and the Bay of Penco. He returned to Valparaiso on the 30th
of September, and reported his success to the governor, who now had
two hundred Spaniards at Santiago, besides women and children. In the
same year Valdivia sent a captain named Bohan to found a town in the
valley of Coquimbo, to serve as a refuge and resting-place on the road
between Santiago and Peru. It was named La Serena, after the native place
of Valdivia. The “San Pedro” was sent to Coquimbo to be caulked
and otherwise repaired.</p>

<p>The governor then undertook an expedition to

place called Quilacara, and advanced as far as the banks of the river Biobio,
returning to Santiago, after an absence of forty days, in March, 1546.

port of Lima. He had founded a new colony, and left it securely established

<p>During the seven years of Valdivia’s absence in Chili, stirring events
had occurred in the land of the Yncas. The marquis returned to Lima,
where he was busily engaged in the work of building, and in administering
the affairs of his vast command. Many of the ruined followers of Almagro
were there also, driven to desperation by the confiscation of their property.
They were called, in derision, the “men of Chili.” Pizarro treated them
with contemptuous indifference, and expelled the young Almagro from
his house.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous of the malcontents was Juan de Rada; and he
matured a plot for the assassination of the governor. On the 26th of
June, 1541, the conspirators, headed by Rada, ran across the great square
during the dinner hour, and entered the court of Pizarro’s house.<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> The
marquis had just dined, and his brother Martin de Alcantara, the judge
Velasquez, Francisco de Chaves, and others were with him. Being unarmed,
several of those present, on hearing the outcry, let themselves
down into a garden from the corridor, and escaped. Chaves went out on
the stairs, where he was murdered by the conspirators, who were running
up. The marquis had thrown off his robe, put on a cuirass, and seized
a spear. He was past seventy. His brother, a cavalier named Gomez
de Luna, and two pages were with him. The assassins numbered nineteen
strong men. Pizarro fought valiantly, until Rada thrust one of his companions
on the spear and rushed in. Alcantara, Luna, and the two pages
were despatched. Pizarro continued to defend himself until a wound in
the throat brought him to the ground. He made the sign of the cross on
the floor, and kissed it. He then breathed his last. The conspirators
rushed into the street shouting, “The tyrant is dead!” The houses of
the governor and his secretary were pillaged. Juan de Rada coerced the
municipality and proclaimed Diego Almagro, the young half-caste lad,
governor of Peru. The body of Pizarro was buried in the cathedral, by
stealth, and at night.</p>

<p>But the colonists did not immediately submit to the new rule. Alvarez
de Holguin, one of Pizarro’s captains, held Cusco with a small force, and
Alonzo de Alvarado opposed the conspiracy in the north of Peru. The
bishop Valverde, of Cusco, and the judge Velasquez were allowed to embark
at Callao in November, 1541; but they fell into the hands of the Indians
on the island of Puna, in the Gulf of Guayaquil, and were both killed.</p>

<p>The followers of Almagro the lad, as he was called, determined to
march from Lima in the direction of Cusco, so as to get between Alvarado
and Holguin. At Xauxa the youthful adventurer had the misfortune to
lose his most trusty adherent. Juan de Rada died of fever. The two most
influential of his supporters who remained were Cristóval de Sotelo and
Garcia de Alvarado,&mdash;and they had quarrelled with one another. Their
delays enabled Holguin to pass to the north, and unite his forces with
Alvarado’s. Almagro then established himself at Cusco, where Sotelo was
murdered by his rival Alvarado; and the latter was put to death by the
young Almagro, who assumed the direction of his own affairs. He was
barely twenty-two years of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor Charles V., long before the death of Pizarro, had decided
upon sending out a royal judge to act as the old conqueror’s coadjutor and
adviser, especially with regard to the treatment of the Indians. For this
delicate post the emperor’s choice fell upon Dr. Don Cristóval Vaca de
Castro, a Judge of the Audience of Valladolid. After a long voyage the new
judge had landed at Buenaventura, a town recently founded by Pascual de
Andagoya, near that river San Juan where Pizarro had waited in such dire
distress during his first voyage. He had a royal order to assume the post of
governor of Peru in the event of Pizarro’s death; and on arriving at Popayan
he received tidings of the assassination. He then proclaimed his commission
as governor, and advanced southwards, by way of Quito, along the Peruvian
coast. At Huara he was joined by Alvarado and Holguin with their forces.
He entered Lima, and then proceeded, by way of Xauxa, in search of the
assassins. Young Almagro had a force of five hundred Spaniards, with two
hundred horses; and he had a park of artillery consisting of sixteen pieces
under the direction of the veteran Pedro de Candia. With this force he left
Cusco in July, 1542. Vaca de Castro marched in great haste to Guamanga,
in order to secure that important post before Almagro could reach it from
Cusco. The rebels, as they must be called, took a route along the skirts of
the <i>cordillera</i>, until they reached an elevated plateau called Chupas, above
and a little to the south of the newly built town of Guamanga. Their object
appears to have been to cut off the communications of Vaca de Castro with
the coast. In order to approach them, it was necessary for the royal army to
evacuate Guamanga, and ascend a very steep slope to the terrace-like plateau
where Almagro’s army was posted. It was the 16th of September, 1542, and
the ascent from Guamanga must have occupied the greater part of the day.
The army of Vaca de Castro was marshalled by the veteran Francisco de
Carbajal, an old soldier who had seen forty years’ service in Italy before he
crossed the Atlantic. Carbajal led the troops into action with such skill
that they were protected by intervening ground until they were close to the
enemy; and when Almagro’s artillery opened fire on them, the guns were
so elevated as to do no execution. This led young Almagro to suspect
Pedro de Candia of treachery, and he there and then ran the old gunner
through the body, and pointed one of the guns himself with good effect.
The royal army now began to suffer severely from the better-directed
artillery fire. Then the opposing bodies of cavalry charged, while Carbajal
led a desperate attack with the infantry, and captured Almagro’s guns.
Holguin fell dead; Alvarado was driven back, and young Almagro behaved
with heroic valor. Yet when night closed in, the army of Vaca de Castro
was completely victorious, and five hundred were left dead on the field. It
was a desperately contested action. Almagro fled to Cusco with a few
followers, where he was arrested by the magistrates. Vaca de Castro
followed closely, and on arriving in the city he condemned the lad to
death. Almagro suffered in the great square, and was buried by the side of
his father in the church of La Merced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p>Vaca de Castro assumed the administration of affairs in Peru as royal
governor. In the same year the Dominican Friar Geronimo de Loaysa, a
native of Talavera, became bishop of Lima. He was promoted to the rank
of archbishop in 1545. Another Dominican, Juan de Solano, succeeded
Valverde as bishop of Cusco in 1543. Gonzalo Pizarro, when he returned
from his terrible expedition in the forests east of Quito, was induced by
the governor to retire peaceably to his estates in Charcas. The efforts
of Vaca de Castro as an administrator were directed to regulating the
employment of the natives, and to improving communications.</p>

<p class="p2">When the good Bartolomé Las Casas returned to Spain, in 1538, he published
his famous work on the destruction of the native race of America.
He protested against the Indians being given to the Spaniards in <i>encomienda</i>,
or vassalage for personal service.<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> At last the emperor appointed a
committee consisting of churchmen and lawyers of the highest position,
to sit at Valladolid in 1542, and to consider the whole subject. The
result was the promulgation of what were called the “New Laws.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I. After the death of the conquerors, the <i>repartimientos</i> of Indians, given to them
in <i>encomienda</i>, were not to pass to their heirs, but be placed directly under the king.
Officers of his majesty were to renounce the <i>repartimientos</i> at once.</p>

<p>II. All <i>encomenderos</i> in Peru who had been engaged in the factious wars between
the Pizarros and Almagros were to be deprived.</p>

<p>III. Personal service of the Indians was to be entirely abolished.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Blasco Nuñez Vela was appointed viceroy of Peru to enforce the “New
Laws,” assisted by a court of justice, of which he was president, called the
<i>Audiencia</i> of Lima. There were four other judges, called <i>oidores</i>, or auditors,
named Cepeda, Zarate, Alvarez, and Tejada. The viceroy and his
colleagues embarked at San Lucar on the 3d of November, 1543. Leaving
the judges sick at Panamá, the viceroy landed at Tumbez on the 4th of
March, 1544, with great magnificence, and proceeded by land to Lima,
proclaiming the “New Laws” as he advanced. The Spanish conquerors
were thrown into a state of dismay and exasperation. They entreated
Gonzalo Pizarro to leave his retirement and protect their interests, and
when he entered Cusco he was hailed as procurator-general of Peru. He
seized the artillery at Guamanga, and assembled a force of four hundred
men, while old Francisco de Carbajal, the hero of the battle of Chupas,
became his lieutenant.</p>

<p>The viceroy was a headstrong, violent man, without judgment or capacity
for affairs. His first act after entering Lima was to imprison the late governor,
Vaca de Castro. The principal citizens entreated him not to enforce
the “New Laws” with imprudent haste. But he would listen to no arguments;
and when the auditors arrived from Panamá, he quarrelled with
them, and acted in defiance of their protests. At last the auditors ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
upon the bold step of arresting the viceroy in his palace, and placing him
in confinement. He was sent to the island of San Lorenzo, and a government
was formed with the auditor Cepeda as president, who suspended the
“New Laws” until further instructions could be received from Spain. The
auditor Alvarez was commissioned to embark on board a vessel with the
viceroy, and take him to Panamá.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gonzalo Pizarro was approaching Lima by rapid marches, and
he entered the capital on the 28th of October, 1544, at the head of twelve
hundred Spaniards and several thousand Indians dragging the artillery,
which had formed the special strength of young Almagro. The <i>Audiencia</i>
submitted; the judges administered the oaths, and Gonzalo was declared
governor and captain-general of Peru. At the same time Vaca de Castro
persuaded the captain of a vessel on board of which he was confined in
Callao Bay to get under way and convey him to Panamá. Accusations were
brought against him in Spain, and he was kept in prison for twelve years,
but was eventually acquitted and reinstated.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship conveying the viceroy to Panamá was at sea, the judge
Alvarez liberated him. He landed at Tumbez in October, 1544, denounced
Gonzalo Pizarro and the judge Cepeda as traitors, and called upon all loyal
subjects to support him. Volunteers arrived, and Blasco Nuñez raised his
standard at San Miguel de Piura. Gonzalo Pizarro assembled a rival force
at Truxillo; but the viceroy retreated before him towards Quito, Carbajal
pressing closely on his rear. The retreat was almost a rout. Passing
through Quito, the viceroy took refuge at Pasto, within the jurisdiction of
Sebastian Benalcazar, the governor of Popayan. Early in January, 1546,
having received reinforcements, Blasco Nuñez ventured to advance once
more towards Quito. Gonzalo Pizarro took up a strong position outside;
but the viceroy, now accompanied by Benalcazar, made a detour and entered
Quito. On the 18th of January, 1546, the viceroy led his followers to the
plains of Anaquito, near the town, where his enemy was posted, seven
hundred strong. The battle was not long doubtful. Alvarez the judge was
mortally wounded. Benalcazar was left for dead on the field. The viceroy
was unhorsed and wounded, and while lying on the ground his head was
struck off by order of Pedro de Puelles, Pizarro’s governor of Quito. The
slaughter was terrific. Cruel old Carbajal never showed any mercy, and no
quarter was given. Benalcazar, when he recovered, was allowed to return
to Popayan; and Gonzalo Pizarro attended as chief mourner at the funeral
of the viceroy in the cathedral of Quito.</p>

<p>Leaving a garrison at Quito, under Puelles, Gonzalo began his journey
southwards in July, 1546, and entered Lima in triumph. The only resistance
throughout Peru was from an officer in Charcas named Diego Centeno,
a native of Ciudad Rodrigo, who had come to Peru in 1534 with Pedro
Alvarado. He declared in favor of the viceroy at Chucuito; but Alonzo
Toro, who had been left in command at Cusco by Gonzalo Pizarro, marched
against him, and he fled into the fastnesses of Chichas, in the far south.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
Pizarro was undisputed master of Peru, and his lieutenant Carbajal retired
to Charcas to work the silver mines.</p>

<p>News of the revolt had reached Spain, and the licentiate Pedro de la
Gasca, an astute and very able ecclesiastic, was appointed to proceed to
Peru, and mediate between the viceroy and the malcontents. He received
very full powers, with large discretion, and was entitled president of the
<i>Audiencia</i>. He was very ugly, with a dwarfish body and exceedingly long,
ungainly legs. The president sailed from Spain on the 26th of May, 1546,
and received the news of the viceroy’s death on his arrival at the isthmus.
He brought out with him the announcement of the revocation of the “New
Laws,” owing to the dangerous spirit of discontent they had caused throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
the Indies. They were withdrawn by a decree dated at Malines on the
20th of October, 1545.</p>

<p>The president arrived at Panamá on the 11th of August, 1546, where he
found the fleet of Gonzalo Pizarro, under the command of Pedro de Hinojosa.
Soon afterward Lorenzo de Aldana arrived as an envoy from Pizarro, but
was induced to submit to the president’s authority. Hinojosa followed the
example, and thus Gasca gained possession of the fleet. When the offer of
pardon reached Lima, Gonzalo was advised by his lieutenant Carbajal to
accept the terms; but the auditor Cepeda, who had turned against the
viceroy and administered the oaths of office to a rebel, felt that there could
be no pardon for him. The mad ambition of Pizarro induced him to
listen to Cepeda rather than to Carbajal, and he finally rejected the offer
of pardon; but many of his old followers deserted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span></p>

<p>Lorenzo de Aldana was despatched from Panamá, with several vessels,
in February, 1547, and arrived in Callao Bay; while Diego Centeno once
more rose in the south, and began to collect troops. Gonzalo Pizarro
resolved to abandon Lima and march to Arequipa with only five hundred
men, so numerous had been the desertions from his ranks. Aldana then
entered the capital, while Gasca himself sailed from Panamá on the 10th of
April, 1547, landing at Tumbez on the 13th of June. He advanced to Xauxa,
and great numbers flocked to his standard. Pedro de Valdivia, the governor
of Chili, had landed at Callao, and overtook the president, on his march
towards Cusco, at Andahuaylas.</p>

<p>Gonzalo Pizarro, despairing of being able to make head against the president
Gasca with all the prestige of royal approval on his side, had determined
to retreat into Chili. But he feared to leave Centeno hanging on his rear,
and thought it necessary first to disperse his forces. Centeno occupied a
position near Huarina, at the southeastern angle of Lake Titicaca, upwards
of twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea. Pizarro’s troops advanced
to the attack over an open plain. He had about four hundred and
eighty men, the strength of his army being in his infantry armed with
arquebuses, and disciplined under the direct supervision of Carbajal. Centeno
had a larger force, and was accompanied by Solano, the bishop of
Cusco. Carbajal waited for the attack of the enemy, and then poured a
deadly volley into their ranks. Centeno’s footmen broke and fled; but his
cavalry defeated Pizarro, and would have won the day, if they too had not
been repelled and broken by the admirable steadiness of Carbajal’s arquebusiers.
As it was, Pizarro’s victory was complete, and three hundred and
fifty of Centeno’s followers were killed. All fugitives taken by Carbajal
were put to death without mercy.</p>

<p>The doomed Pizarro now abandoned all idea of retreating into Chili.
He marched in triumph to Cusco, while the president Gasca approached
by leisurely marches, gathering reinforcements by the way. With him were
the bishops of Lima and Cusco, the marshal Alonzo de Alvarado, the veteran
Hinojosa, Pascual de Andagoya the first adventurer in search of Peru,
Valdivia the governor of Chili, Centeno, escaped from Huarina, Cieza de
Leon the future historian, and many others well known to fame. The
president’s army crossed the river Apurimac, and advanced to the plain
of Sacsahuana, near Cusco, whither Gonzalo Pizarro came out to meet him.
On the morning of the 9th of April, 1548, the commanders of both armies
made ready for battle. But soon there were symptoms of desertion on
Pizarro’s side. An important cavalier, Garcilasso de la Vega, galloped
across to the army of Gasca. He was followed by the treacherous auditor
Cepeda. Soldiers began to follow in small parties. Old Carbajal was
humming two lines of an old song,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Estos mis cabellicos madre,<br />
Dos á dos me los lleva el ayre.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Then desertions took place by companies and squadrons. Pizarro sorrowfully
took his way to the royal camp and gave himself up. Carbajal was
seized by the soldiers. He was hanged and quartered the following day, and
soon afterwards Gonzalo Pizarro was executed in presence of the army.</p>

<p>The president entered Cusco on the 12th of April, and began a bloody
assize. Scarcely a day passed without followers of Gonzalo Pizarro being
hanged, flogged, or sent in large batches to the galleys. Two priests were
executed. A canon of Quito, who was tutor to Gonzalo Pizarro’s little
son, was hanged for writing a book called <i>De bello justo</i>. At length, sated
with blood, the president left Cusco on the 11th of July with Archbishop
Loaysa, and went to a small village called Huayna-rimac in the neighborhood.
He retired into this seclusion to escape the importunities of his
partisans. Here he proceeded to arrange the distribution of <i>encomiendas</i>,
or grants of lands and Indians, among his followers. He allowed a tenth
of the Indians to be employed on forced labor in the mines, thus reversing
the humane legislation advocated by Las Casas. Having completed his
work, the president sent the archbishop to announce his awards at Cusco,
and they caused a howl of rage and disappointed greed. Gasca himself
went down to Lima by the unfrequented route of Nasca, and when a
positive order from the emperor arrived, that all personal service among
the Indians should be abolished, he suspended its publication until he was
safe out of Peru. In January, 1550, the president Gasca sailed for Panamá,
leaving the country in the greatest confusion, and all the most difficult
administrative points to be solved by his successors. The municipality of
Lima wrote a complaint to the emperor, representing the untimely departure
of the president. His abilities and his services have been much overstated.
He himself is the witness to his own revolting cruelties at Cusco.</p>

<p>Gasca left the government of Peru, with none of the difficulties settled,
in the hands of the auditors or judges of the royal <i>Audiencia</i>, of which
Don Andres de Cianca was president. His colleagues were Melchor Bravo
de Sarabia, Hernando de Santillan, and Pedro Maldonado. The judges
were in charge of the executive from January, 1550, to the 23d of September,
1551, when Don Antonio de Mendoza arrived from Mexico as viceroy.
They had taken steps to organize a systematic plan for the instruction of
the natives, under the auspices of Archbishop Loaysa, Friar Thomas de
San Martin, and the indefatigable friar Domingo de Santo Tomas, the first
Quichua scholar. They worked harmoniously under the viceroy Mendoza,
who was a statesman of high rank and great experience. He promulgated
the royal order against the enforced personal service of Indians, anticipating
serious discontents and troubles, which he was resolved to meet and
overcome. But his premature death at Lima, on the 21st of July, 1552,
left the country once more in the hands of the judges, who had to meet a
storm which would sorely test their administrative abilities.</p>

<p>The ringleader of the malcontents was a cavalier of good family named
Francisco Hernandez Giron. Born at Caceres, in Estremadura, he crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
the Atlantic in 1535, and joined the unfortunate viceroy Blasco Nuñez de
Vela at Quito, fighting under his banner in the fatal battle of Anaquito.
He also did good service in the army of President Gasca, and was in the
left wing at the rout of Sacsahuana. Gasca had assigned the plain of
Sacsahuana to him, as his <i>repartimiento</i>; but he grumbled loudly, and all
the malcontents looked upon him as their leader. The promulgation of the
abolition of personal service was received with a howl of execration among
the conquerors, who looked forward to the accumulation of wealth by the
use of forced labor in the silver mines. Troubles broke out in Charcas,
and Giron resolved to raise the standard of revolt at Cusco.</p>

<p>The 12th of November, 1553, was the wedding day of Don Alonzo de
Loaysa, a nephew of the archbishop, who married a young lady named
Maria de Castilla. The <i>corregidor</i> of Cusco and most of the leading citizens
were at the supper. Suddenly Giron presented himself in cuirass and
helmet, with his sword drawn, and a crowd of conspirators behind him.
The street was occupied by a body of cavalry under his lieutenant, Tomas
Vasquez. The guests sprang from their seats, but Giron told them not to
fear, as he only wished to arrest the <i>corregidor</i>. He and the others then
put out the lights and drew their swords. The <i>corregidor</i> took refuge with
the ladies in the drawing-room, and shut the doors. Two guests were
stabbed. Many escaped by the windows and climbed a wall at the back
of the house. The <i>corregidor</i> and other officials were seized and imprisoned.
Giron issued a proclamation declaring that the conquerors would
not be robbed of the fruits of their labors. He soon had a respectable
force under his command; but most of the leading citizens fled to Lima.
The rebel declared that his object was the public good, and to induce the
king to listen to the prayers of his subjects. The <i>Audiencia</i> was called
upon to restore matters to the state they were in at the time of Gasca’s
departure. Tomas Vasquez was sent to Arequipa, and Guamanga also
declared in favor of Giron.</p>

<p>The governing judges were in great perplexity at Lima. After some
hesitation they put the archbishop Loaysa in command of their army,
with the judge Bravo de Saravia as his colleague. The marshal Alonzo de
Alvarado was in upper Peru, and he also got some loyal cavaliers round
him, and assembled a small force. Giron entered Guamanga Jan. 27,
1554, where he was joined by Tomas Vasquez, from Arequipa; and he
then marched down to the coast. The judges encamped at Até, outside
Lima, with five hundred arquebusiers, four hundred and fifty pikemen,
three hundred cavalry, and fourteen field-pieces. Giron arrived at
Pachacamac on the shores of the Pacific, and the judges advanced to
Surco. But instead of boldly attacking, the rebels turned their backs and
marched southwards along the coast to Yca, followed by a detachment
under an officer named Meneses. Giron turned, and defeated his pursuers
at Villacuri, in the desert between Pisco and Yca, but continued his retreat
to Nasca. He had lost a great opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>The royal army advanced to Chincha; but the archbishop quarrelled
with Bravo de Saravia, and where so many commanded, and none were
military men, efficient operations were impossible. Meanwhile Alvarado
had assembled an army for the judges, of seven hundred men, the rendezvous
being La Paz in upper Peru. With this force he entered Cusco on
the 30th of March, 1554, and continued his march in search of Giron,
who remained at Nasca, on the coast, until the 8th of May. On that
day the rebels once more ascended the wild passes of the <i>cordillera</i> to
Lucanas, and were soon in the neighborhood of Alvarado’s army, which
now numbered eleven hundred men. The rebels encamped at Chuquinga,
in the wildest part of the Andes, on a mountain terrace by the side
of a deep ravine, with the river Abancay in front. The marshal Alvarado
was on the other side of the ravine, and was advised not to attack, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
harass the retreat of Giron. But on the 21st of May, under every possible
disadvantage, he ordered the river to be forded, and an attack to be
made. The river was crossed, but the men could not form on the other
side in the face of an active enemy. They fell back, and the retreat was
soon converted into a rout. Alvarado was wounded, but contrived to
escape with Lorenzo de Aldana and the learned Polo de Ondegardo who
accompanied him, leaving seventy dead on the field, and two hundred and
eighty wounded.</p>

<p>Giron entered Cusco in triumph. The judges, on receiving news of the
disastrous battle of Chuquinga, decided that their army should advance to
Xauxa, and eventually towards Cusco. The <i>Audiencia</i> now consisted of
Dr. Melchor Bravo de Saravia, Hernando de Santillan, Diego Gonzalez
Altamirano, and Martin Mercado. Altamirano was to remain in charge of
the government at Lima, while the other judges marched with the army,
preceded by their officer Pablo de Meneses with the royal standard. In
July, 1554, the three judges, Saravia, Santillan, and Mercado reached
Guamanga, and in August they entered Cusco, having met with no opposition.
Giron had retreated to Pucara, near Lake Titicaca, a very strong
position consisting of a lofty rock rising out of the plain. The royal army
encamped in front of the rock, and the judges sent promises of pardon to
all who would return to their allegiance. Giron hoped that the royal army
would attack him, repeating the error at Chuquinga; but the judges had
resolved to play a waiting game. A night attack led by Giron was repulsed.
Then desertions began, Tomas Vasquez setting the example. The unfortunate
rebel could trust no one. He feared treachery. He bade a heart-rending
farewell to his noble-minded wife, Doña Mencia, leaving her to the
care of the judge Saravia. He rode away in the dead of night, almost
alone, and Pucara was surrendered. Meneses was sent in chase of Giron,
who was captured near Xauxa. He was brought to Lima, Dec. 6, 1554,
and beheaded. His head was put in an iron cage, and nailed up by the
side of those of Gonzalo Pizarro and Carbajal. Ten years afterward
a friend of his wife secretly took all three down, and they were buried
in a convent. Doña Mencia, the widow of Giron, founded the first
nunnery in Lima,&mdash;that of “La Encarnacion,”&mdash;and died there as
abbess.</p>

<p>Thus the judges succeeded in putting down this formidable insurrection,
and were able to hand over the country, in a state of outward tranquillity,
to the great viceroy who now came out to establish order in Peru.</p>

<p class="p2">Don Andrea Hurtado de Mendoza, Marquis of Cañete, was nominated
by Charles V., at Brussels, to be viceroy of Peru for six years. He came
out with the intention of checking with a firm hand the turbulence of the
military adventurers who were swarming over the country. Writing to
the emperor before he sailed, May 9, 1555, he said that there were
eight thousand Spaniards in Peru, of whom four hundred and eighty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
held <i>repartimientos</i>, and about one thousand were employed officially or
otherwise. A large portion desired to live in idleness. He proposed to
employ them on expeditions into unknown regions, and he submitted that
no more Spaniards ought to be allowed to come to Peru without good
cause assigned. In a letter to his daughter, the governess Juana, the
emperor approved the policy sketched out by the new viceroy.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Cañete landed at Payta, and travelling by land, entered
Lima on the 29th of June, 1556. He assumed office with unprecedented
state and solemnity. He was fully resolved to put down sedition once
and for all. He ordered that no Spaniard should leave his town without
permission of the authorities, and for good cause. As regards the <i>Audiencia</i>,
he reported to the emperor that the judges were hostile to each
other, and that they lived in such discord that all peace was hopeless.
He spoke favorably of two, and requested that the others might be
recalled. He also reported that the <i>corregidors</i> maintained quantities of
idle soldiers waiting for opportunities of mischief. He estimated the
number of the idlers at three thousand, and said that the peace of the
country was endangered by the immorality, license, and excesses of these
men. The viceroy kept all the artillery in the country under his own eye,
ordering guns to be seized and brought to him wherever they could be
found; and he formed a permanent guard of four hundred arquebusiers.
He then sent for a number of settlers, of turbulent antecedents, who came
to Lima joyfully, expecting that they were about to receive <i>repartimientos</i>.
But he disarmed them, shipped them at Callao, and sent them out of the
country. Among these banished men were included the most notorious
disturbers of the peace in the late civil wars. Altogether thirty-seven
were sent to Spain. Tomas Vasquez and Juan Piedrahita, the chief
supporters of Giron, were beheaded, and the <i>corregidors</i> were authorized
to seize and execute any turbulent or dangerous persons within their
jurisdictions. These were very strong measures, but they were necessary.
The intolerable anarchy under which Peru had groaned for so many years
was thus stamped out. Moderate <i>encomiendas</i> were then granted to
deserving officers.</p>

<p>While the turbulence and cruelty of the Spanish conquerors were
checked with relentless severity, the policy of the Marquis of Cañete towards
the people and their ancient rulers was liberal and conciliatory. In both
courses of action there was wisdom. After the siege of Cusco, the Ynca
Manco, with his family and chief nobles, had taken refuge in the mountain
fastness of Vilcabamba, and there he met his death in 1553, after a disastrous
reign of twenty years. He was succeeded by his son Sayri Tupac, who
continued in his secluded hiding-place. The viceroy thought it important,
for the tranquillity of the country and the peace of mind of the Indians,
that the descendant of their ancient kings should be induced to reside
among the Spaniards. The negotiation was intrusted to the Ynca’s aunt,
a princess who had married a Spanish cavalier, and to Juan de Betanzos, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
excellent Quichua scholar. It was settled that the Ynca should receive
the <i>encomienda</i> forfeited by Giron (the valley of Yucay near Cusco, where
he was to reside), together with a large pension. All was finally arranged,
and on the 6th of January, 1558, the Ynca entered Lima, and was most cordially
received by the viceroy. From that time he resided in the valley of
Yucay, surrounded by his family and courtiers, until his death in 1560.</p>

<p>Several of the Spanish conquerors had married Ynca ladies of the blood
royal, and a number of half-caste youths were growing up in the principal
cities of Peru, who formed links between the Yncas and their conquerors.
There was a school at Cusco where they were educated, and the Ynca
Garcilasso de la Vega records many anecdotes of his early days, and
enumerates the names of most of his school-fellows. The Marquis of
Cañete also founded schools at Lima and Truxillo, and took great pains
to supply the Indians with parochial clergy of good conduct, who were
strictly prohibited from trading. In 1558 the <i>curacas</i>, or native chiefs,
who had proved their rights by descent before the <i>Audiencia</i>, were allowed
to exercise jurisdiction as magistrates.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Cañete founded the towns of Cuenca in the province of
Quito, of Santa on the coast to the north of Lima, and of Cañete in a rich
and fertile valley to the south. He also established the hospital of San
Andres at Lima, and built the first bridge over the Rimac. Very great
activity was shown in the introduction of useful plants and domestic
animals. Vines were sent out from Spain and the Canaries, and a harvest
of grapes was reaped near Cusco in 1555. Wheat was first reaped in the
valley of Cañete by a lady named Maria de Escobar, and olives were planted
in 1560. Other fruit trees and garden vegetables soon followed.</p>

<p>The king, Philip II., determined to supersede this able viceroy in 1560,
appointing a young nobleman named Diego Lopez de Zuñiga y Velasco,
Conde de Nieva, in his place. But the Marquis of Cañete died at Lima
before his successor arrived, on the 30th of March, 1561, having governed
nearly five years. He was buried in the church of San Francisco, but his
bones were afterwards taken to Spain and deposited with those of his
ancestors at Cuenca. The Conde de Nieva entered Lima on the 27th of
April,&mdash;a month after the death of the marquis. He was a handsome
young cavalier, of loose morals, and fond of every sort of pleasure. There
is very little doubt that he lost his life owing to a powerful husband’s jealousy.
He was set upon in the street, after leaving the lady’s house, in the
dead of night. He was found dead on the 20th of February, 1564, and the
matter was hushed up to prevent scandal. The judges of the <i>Audiencia</i>
took charge of the government until the arrival of a successor.</p>

<p class="p2">During this period the Chilian colony was holding its own, with difficulty,
against the indomitable Araucanian Indians. After the rout of Sacsahuana,
the governor Valdivia took his leave of the president Gasca, and embarked
at Arica on the 21st of January, 1549, with two hundred men. His lieutenant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
Francisco de Villagra, had ruled at Santiago in his absence, vigilantly
thwarting a plot of Alonzo de Hoz, whom he executed, and suppressing
a revolt of the Indians of Coquimbo and Copiapo. He met Valdivia on
his landing at Valparaiso and accompanied him to the capital. The first
expedition of the governor, after his return, was undertaken with a view
to establishing Spanish influence in the south of Chili. In January, 1550,
with two hundred men, he crossed the Biobio, and intrenched himself in
the valley of the Penco, where he founded the town of Concepcion, repulsing
an attack from a large army of Indians with great slaughter. In the
following year he founded the towns of Imperial and Valdivia still farther
south.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Araucanians now flew to arms in defence of their fatherland, at the
call of their aged chief, Colo-colo. A younger but equally brave leader,
named Caupolican, was elected <i>toqui</i>, or general, of the army; and they
began operations by attempting to destroy a Spanish fort at Tucapel.
Valdivia hurried from Concepcion, at the head of fifty cavalry, and attacked
the Araucanian host. The governor had with him a young Indian lad of
eighteen, named Lautaro, as groom. There was great slaughter among the
Araucanians, and they were beginning to give way, when all the best feelings
of Lautaro were aroused at the sight of his countrymen in peril. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
the instant he felt the glow of ardent patriotism. He went over to the
enemy, exhorted them to rally, and led them once more to the attack.
The Spanish force was annihilated, and the governor was taken prisoner.
Led before the <i>toqui</i>, young Lautaro interceded for his master, and the
generous Caupolican listened favorably; but the savage chief Leucaton
protested, and felled Valdivia by a deadly blow with a club on the back
of the head. This disaster took place on the last day of December, 1553.
Don Pedro de Valdivia was in his fifty-sixth year, and by his conquest and
settlement of Chili he won a place in history side by side with Cortés and
Pizarro. He was childless.</p>

<p>Francisco de Villagra succeeded his old chief as governor of Chili, and
made preparations to repair the disaster. Lautaro became the second
leader of his countrymen, under Caupolican. Their tactics were to allow
the Spaniards to penetrate into their country as far as they pleased, but
to cut off supplies, and harass their retreat. Thus Villagra easily marched
from Arauco to Tucapel; but he was attacked by an immense army under
Lautaro, which stopped his retreat, and he suffered such severe loss in the
battle of Mariguanu that the town of Concepcion was abandoned in
November, 1555. There was hard fighting again in 1556, in defence of the
garrisons at Imperial and Valdivia. Early in the following year Lautaro
was intrenched with an army on the banks of the Mataquito, when he was
surprised at dawn by Villagra. He made a gallant defence, but was killed;
and six hundred warriors fell with him. Thus died one of the noblest
patriots of the American race.</p>

<p>In the same year the viceroy, Marquis of Cañete, appointed his son,
Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, a youth barely twenty-two years of age,
to be governor of Chili. His cavalry, under Luis de Toledo, marched by
land over the desert of Atacama, while the young governor embarked at
Callao, and sailed for Chili with three vessels conveying seven hundred
infantry. Among the officers was Don Alonso de Ercilla, whose epic poem
records the events of this famous war. Don Garcia landed at Coquimbo
on the 25th of April, 1557, and the cavalry arrived on the following day.
After having assumed the government at Santiago, and ungratefully dismissed
Villagra, to secure the tranquillity of his own rule, he continued
the interminable war. His first operation was to occupy the island of
Quiriquina, off Talcahuano, and to build the fort of Pinto on the west side
of the valley of the Penco. Here he was attacked by Caupolican with a
great army. There were marvellous individual acts of bravery on both
sides; Don Garcia himself was wounded, and two thousand Araucanians
were slain. The governor then crossed the river Biobio and fought
another great battle, Caupolican retreating with heavy loss. Don Garcia
disgraced his victory by hanging twelve captive chiefs, including the heroic
Galvarino.</p>

<p>Penetrating far to the south, the town of Osorno was
founded beyond Valdivia, and the archipelago of Chiloe was discovered.
During the governor’s absence in the far south, the <i>toqui</i> Caupolican
was betrayed into the hands of Alonso de Reinosa, the captain in command
at Tucapel, who put him to a horrible death by impalement.</p>

<p>There was now a brief interval of peace. Don Garcia had brought with
him to Chili the good licentiate Gonzalez Marmolejo, afterwards first bishop
of Santiago, who prepared rules for the humane treatment of the peaceful
natives. Only a sixth were allowed to be employed at the mines; no one
was to work who was
under eighteen or
over fifty; no laborer
was to be forced to
work on feast days, and
all were to be paid and
supplied with food.
On the 5th of February,
1561, Don Garcia
Hurtado de Mendoza
embarked at Valparaiso
and left Chili,
being succeeded by
Francisco de Villagra,
the old companion in
arms of Valdivia. Villagra
died in 1563, and
was succeeded by Rodrigo
de Quiroga. In
1563 the bishopric of
Santiago was founded, and in 1565 the royal <i>Audiencia</i> of Chili was instituted,
with Dr. Melchor Bravo de Saravia as its first president. Its seat
was fixed in the city of Concepcion.</p>

<p class="p2">We must now return to the course of events in Peru. The scandalous
death of the viceroy Conde de Nieva seems to have induced the king to
choose his successor from among men learned in the law rather than from
the nobility, and to drop the title of viceroy. Lope Garcia de Castro had
been a judge of the <i>Audiencia</i> of Valladolid, and afterwards a member of the
council of the Indies. He was appointed governor and captain-general
of Peru, and president of the <i>Audiencia</i> of Lima, where he made his public
entry Sept. 22, 1564. To avoid scandal, the belief had been encouraged
that the Conde de Nieva had been murdered in bed. But everybody knew
that he had been struck to the ground by several stout negroes with bags
full of sand; that the blows had been continued until life was extinct; and
that after the murder people came out of the house of the Zarates, and
carried the body to the palace. The culprit was Don Rodrigo Manrique
de Lara, a powerful citizen of proud lineage, who had discovered love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
passages between his young wife and her near relative the viceroy. But
the judges thought there would be grave scandal if the delinquent was
brought to justice, and the new governor took the same view. The affair
was hushed up.</p>

<p>Lope de Castro established a mint, imposed the <i>almojarifazgo</i>, or customs
dues, and organized the work at the newly-discovered quicksilver mines of
Huancavelica, and at the silver mines. In 1567 the Jesuits arrived in Peru,
and in the same year the second council of Lima was convoked by Archbishop
Loaysa, the governor assisting as representative of the king. The
first council was in 1552. At the second the decisions of the council
of Trent were accepted, and the parochial arrangements were made; while
the governor proceeded with the work of fixing the divisions of land
among the Indians, and marking out the country into <i>corregimientos</i>, or
provinces, under <i>corregidors</i>. In 1567 Castro despatched an expedition
from Callao, under the command of his nephew, Alvaro de Mendaña, who
discovered the Solomon Islands. Lope Garcia de Castro governed Peru
for five years, handing over his charge to his successor, in 1569, to return
to Spain and resume his seat at the council board of the Indies.</p>

<p>Don Francisco de Toledo, second son of the third Count of Oropesa,
was the king’s major-domo, and was advanced in years when he was
selected to succeed the licentiate Lope de Castro. In his case the title
of viceroy was revived, and was retained by his successors until the
independence. Landing at Payta, the viceroy Toledo travelled along
the coast, closely observing the condition both of Spaniards and Indians;
and he then made up his mind to visit every province within his government.
He made his public entrance into Lima on the 26th of November,
1569.</p>

<p>Toledo was assisted by statesmen of great ability and experience, who
warmly sympathized with the aboriginal races, and were anxious for their
welfare. Chief among his advisers was the licentiate Polo de Ondegardo,
who had now been several years in Peru, had filled important administrative
posts,&mdash;especially as <i>corregidor</i> of Charcas and of Cusco,&mdash;and had
studied the system of the government and civilization of the Yncas with
minute attention, especially as regards the tenures of land, and always with
a view to securing justice to the natives. The licentiate Juan Matienzo
was another upright and learned minister who had studied the indigenous
civilization and the requirements of colonial policy with great care; while
in affairs relating to religion and the instruction of the people, the viceroy
consulted the accomplished Jesuit author, José de Acosta.</p>

<p>But the conduct of Toledo with regard to the Ynca royal family was
dictated by a narrow view of political expediency, and was alike unwise
and iniquitous. He reversed the generous and enlightened policy of the
Marquis of Cañete. After the death of Sayri Tupac, the Ynca court had
again retired into the mountain fastnesses of Vilcabamba, where the late
Ynca’s two brothers, Titu Cusi Yupanqui and Tupac Amaru, resided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
many native chiefs and followers. When the new viceroy arrived at
Cusco, in January, 1571, the Ynca Titu Cusi sent an embassy to him,
and requested that ministers of religion might be sent to Vilcabamba.
Accordingly, the friar Diego Ortiz arrived at the Ynca court; but almost
immediately afterward Titu Cusi sickened and died, and the superstitious
people, believing that it was the work of the friar, put him to death. The
youthful Tupac Amaru was then proclaimed Ynca, as successor to his
brother. This gave the viceroy the pretext he sought. He despatched
a strong force into Vilcabamba, under the command of Martin Garcia
Loyola, who was married to an Ynca princess, the daughter of Sayri
Tupac. Loyola penetrated into Vilcabamba, and took young Tupac
Amaru prisoner on the 4th of October, 1571. He was brought to Cusco
and confined in a palace, under the shadow of the great fortress, which
until now had belonged to the family of his uncle, the Ynca Paullu. But
the viceroy had seized it as a strong position to be held by Spanish troops
under his uncle Don Luis de Toledo. There was a trial for the murder
of the friar; several chiefs were sentenced to be strangled, and Tupac
Amaru, who was perfectly innocent and against whom there was no
evidence, was to be beheaded.</p>

<p>The young sovereign was instructed for several days by two monks who
were excellent Quichua scholars, and who spoke the language with grace
and elegance. He was then taken to a scaffold, which had been erected
in the great square. The open spaces and the hills above the town were
covered with dense crowds of people. When the executioner produced
his knife, there was such a shout of grief and horror that the Spaniards
were amazed, and there were few of them with a dry eye. The boy was
perfectly calm. He raised his right arm, and there was profound silence.
He spoke a few simple words of resignation, and the scene was so heart-rending
that the hardest of the conquerors lost self-control. Led by the
bishop and the heads of the monasteries, they rushed to the house of
the viceroy and threw themselves on their knees, praying for mercy and
entreating him to send the Ynca to Spain to be judged by the king.
Toledo was a laborious administrator, but his heart was harder than the
nether millstone. He sent off the chief Alguazil, of Cusco, to cause the
sentence to be executed without delay. The crime was perpetrated amid
deafening shouts of grief and horror, while the great bell of the cathedral
was tolled. The body was taken to the palace of the Ynca’s mother, and
was afterward interred in the principal chapel of the cathedral, after a solemn
service performed by the bishop and the chapter. Toledo caused
the head to be cut off and stuck on a pike beside the scaffold; but such
vast crowds came to worship before it every day, that it was taken down
and interred with the body.</p>

<p>The judicial murder of Tupac Amaru was part of a settled policy.
Toledo intended to crush out all remains of reverence and loyalty for
the ancient family among the people. He confiscated the property of
the Yncas, deprived them of most of the privileges they had hitherto been
allowed to retain, and even banished the numerous half-caste children of
Spaniards by Ynca princesses.</p>

<p>At the same time he labored diligently to formulate and establish a
colonial policy and system of government on the ruins of the civilization
of the Yncas.</p>

<p class="p2">The instructions of the kings of Spain, through their council of the
Indies, were remarkable for beneficence and liberality in all that concerned
the natives. Strict orders were given for their instruction and kind treatment,
and special officers were appointed for their protection. But at the
same time there were incessant demands for increased supplies of treasure
from the mines. It was like the orders of the directors of the East India
Company to Warren Hastings,&mdash;justice to the natives, but more money.
The two orders were incompatible. In spite of their beneficent rules and
good intentions, the Spanish kings must share the guilt of their colonial
officers, as regards the treatment of the natives. It is right, however, that
the names of those conquerors should be recorded who displayed feelings
of sympathy and kindness for their Indian vassals. Lorenzo de Aldana,
who took a prominent and important part in the civil wars, died at
Arequipa in 1556, and left all his property to the Indians whom he had
received in <i>repartimiento</i>, for the payment of their tribute in future years.
Marcio Sierra de Leguizamo described the happy condition of the people
when the Spaniards arrived, and in his will expressed deep contrition at
having taken part in their destruction. Garcilasso de la Vega was ever kind
and considerate to his Indian vassals. Cieza de Leon in his writings<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>
shows the warmest sympathy for the Ynca people. There were, however,
too many of the first conquerors of a different stamp.</p>

<p class="p2">The viceroy Toledo wisely based his legislation on the system of the
Yncas. His elaborate code, called the <i>Libro de Tasas</i>, was the text-book
for all future viceroys. He fixed the amount of tribute to be paid by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
Indians, wholly exempting all males under the age of eighteen, and over
that of fifty. He recognized the positions of hereditary nobles or <i>curacas</i>,
assigning them magisterial functions, and the duty of collecting the tribute
and paying it to the Spanish <i>corregidors</i>. He enacted that one seventh
part of the population of every village should be subject to the <i>mita</i>, or
forced labor in mines or factories; at the same time fixing the distance
they might be taken from their homes, and the payment they were to
receive. It was the abuse of the <i>mita</i> system, and the habitual infraction
of the rules established by Toledo, which caused all the subsequent misery
and the depopulation of the country. Humane treatment of the people
was incompatible with the annual despatch of vast treasure to Spain.
Toledo also fixed the tenures of land, organized local government by
<i>corregidors</i>, and specified the duties of all officials, in his voluminous
code of ordinances.</p>

<p>In the days of this viceroy the Inquisition was introduced into Peru,
but the natives were exempted from its penalties as catechumens. Heretical
Europeans or Creoles were alone exposed to its terrible jurisdiction.
The first <i>auto da fé</i> took place at Lima on November 19, 1573, when
a crazy old hermit, suspected of Lutheranism, was burned. Another was
celebrated with great pomp on the 13th of April, 1578, the viceroy and
judges of the <i>Audiencia</i> being present in a covered stand on the great
square of Lima. There were sixteen victims to suffer various punishments,
but none were put to death.</p>

<p>During the government of Toledo, in 1579, Sir Francis Drake appeared
on the coast of Peru,<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> and in the following year the viceroy despatched an
important surveying expedition to the Straits of Magellan under Sarmiento.
After a long and eventful period of office, extending over upwards of twelve
years, Don Francisco de Toledo returned to Spain. He was coldly
received by Philip II., who said that he had not been sent to Peru to
kill kings, and dismissed him. He was a hard-hearted man, but a conscientious
and able administrator, and a devoted public servant.</p>

<p>Don Martin Henriquez, second son of the Marquis of Alcanizes, was
then viceroy of Mexico, whence he was removed to Peru as successor to
Toledo. He entered Lima on the 28th of September, 1581. He worked
assiduously to carry out the ordinances of his able predecessor in all
branches of administration; but his career was cut short by death after
holding office for eighteen months. He died on the 15th of March, 1583,
and was buried in the church of San Francisco. In 1582 he had founded
the college of San Martin, to be under the rule of Jesuits, and on the 15th
of August of the same year the second council of Lima assembled under
the presidency of the archbishop.</p>

<p>Loaysa, the first archbishop of Lima, died in 1575, and the see was
vacant for six years. Toribio de Mogrovejo was consecrated at Seville in
1580, and entered Lima May 24, 1581, at the age of forty-three. He at
once began the study of the Quichua language, to prepare for his tours of
inspection. He had a mule, but generally travelled on foot, stopping in
villages and at wayside huts, instructing, catechising, and administering the
sacraments. He penetrated into the most inaccessible fastnesses of the
Andes and visited all the coast valleys, journeying over burning deserts,
along snowy heights, and through dense forests, year after year untiringly.
He founded the seminary at Lima, for the education of priests, which is now
known by his name. Besides the council of 1582, he celebrated two other
provincial councils in 1592 and 1601, and ten diocesan synods. The principal
work of these assemblies was to draw up catechisms and questions for
the use of priests, with a view to the extirpation of idolatry, and to regulate
parochial work. The good archbishop died at Saña on the coast, during one
of his laborious visitations, on the 23d of March, 1606. He was canonized
in 1680, and is revered as Saint Toribio. During his archiepiscopate a girl
was born at Lima, of very poor and honest Spanish parents, named Rosa
Flores, and was baptized by Saint Toribio in 1586. Her goodness and
charity were equalled by her surpassing beauty, which she dedicated to
God; and after her death, in 1617, a conclave of theologians decided that
she had never strayed from the right path in thought or deed. She was
canonized in 1671, and Santa Rosa is the patron saint of Lima, with her
festival on the 30th of August.<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a></p>

<p>Don Fernando de Torres y Portugal, Conde de Villar Don Pardo, the
successor of Henriquez, did not reach Lima until the 20th of November,
1586. He endeavored to prevent abuses in taking Indians for the <i>mita</i>,
and ordered that none should be sent to unsuitable climates. During the
previous forty years negroes had been imported into the coast valleys of
Peru in considerable numbers as slaves, and supplied labor for the rich
cotton and sugar estates. The Conde de Villar was an old man, with good
intentions but limited capacity. He allowed abuses to creep into the
financial accounts, which were in great confusion when he was superseded
in the year 1590.</p>

<p>Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, the fourth marquis of Cañete, had
already served in Peru, when his father was viceroy, and had won renown
in his war with the Araucanians. He had also seen service in Germany
and Italy. Married to Doña Teresa de Castro y de la Cueva, granddaughter
of the proud Duke of Albuquerque, he was the first viceroy who had been
allowed to take a vice-queen with him to Peru, and he was also accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
by her brother, the gallant and chivalrous Don Beltran de Castro y Cueva,
as commander of the forces. On the 6th of January, 1590, the new viceroy
made his solemn entry into Lima, in a magnificent procession of richly
adorned Indian nobles, arquebusiers and pikemen, gentlemen of the household,
judges of the <i>Audiencia</i>, professors and students of the University of
San Marcos, and kings-at-arms. The marquis came out with the usual injunctions
to enforce the kindly treatment of Indians, but he received urgent
demands from the king for more and more money. In 1591 he imposed the
<i>alcabala</i>, or duties on sales in markets, and on coca. He was obliged to
send increasing numbers of victims to the silver mines, and to the quicksilver
mines of Huancavelica. He made numerous ordinances for the regulation
of industries and of markets, the suppression of gambling, and the
punishment of fugitive slaves. He founded the college of San Felipe and
San Marcos at Lima in 1592. He despatched an important expedition under
Mandaña, which discovered the Marquesas Islands. He was an active
and intelligent ruler; but all the good he attempted to do was counterbalanced
by the calls for treasure from Spain. He sent home 1,500,000
ducats, besides value in jewels and plate.</p>

<p>After having governed Peru for six years and a half, the Marquis of
Cañete begged to be allowed to return home. He was succeeded by Don
Luis de Velasco, Marquis of Salinas, who came from Mexico, where he
had been the viceroy. The Marquis of Salinas entered Lima on the 24th
of July, 1596, and governed Peru until the end of 1604.</p>

<p class="p2">Chili had been comparatively quiet under the immediate successors of
Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, although the war with the Araucanians
had never actually ceased. In 1583 Philip II. selected a military officer of
great experience and approved valor as governor of Chili. Don Alonso
de Sotomayor left Spain for Buenos Ayres with seven hundred men, and
made the journey across the Pampas and over the pass of Uspallata, reaching
Santiago on the 22d of September, 1583. He and his brother Luis
carried on a desultory war against the Araucanians for several years.
During 1588 the attacks of the Indians were led by an intrepid heroine
named Janequeo, who was resolved to avenge the death of her husband.
The governor was superseded in 1592 and proceeded to Callao, where he
commanded a ship, under Don Beltran de Cueva, in the fleet which attacked
and captured Sir Richard Hawkins and his ship. Sotomayor then
returned to Spain.</p>

<p>The new governor of Chili was Don Martin Garcia Oñez de Loyola, the
same cavalier who married an Ynca princess, and captured young Tupac
Amaru. He was a Basque, of the province of Guipuzcoa, and a near relative
of Saint Ignatius. He arrived at Valparaiso, with four hundred soldiers and
abundant supplies of warlike stores, on the 23d of September, 1592, reaching
Santiago on the 6th of October. The Araucanians had elected the
aged chief Paillamacu as their <i>toqui</i>, with two younger warriors named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
Pelantaru and Millacalquin as his lieutenants. Believing the subjugation
of Araucaria to be practicable, the new governor traversed the country
between Imperial and Villarica during the year 1597, but failed to discover
his astute foes. In the spring of 1598 Loyola was at Imperial, where he
received a letter from his wife, the Ynca princess Doña Beatriz Coya,
urging him to retreat to Concepcion, as the Araucanians were rising.
He set out for Angol, accompanied by only sixty officers, on the 21st
of November, 1598, and stopped for the night in the valley of Curalaba.
When all were wrapped in sleep, the tents were attacked by five hundred
native warriors, and the governor was killed, with all his companions.
His widow, the Ynca princess, went to Spain with a young daughter,
who was given in marriage by Philip III. to Juan Henriquez de Borja,
heir of the house of Gandia, and was at the same time created Marquesa
de Oropesa.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The death of the governor was a signal for a general rising. Within
forty-eight hours there were thirty thousand Araucanian warriors in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
field under the <i>toqui</i> Paillamacu. All the Spanish towns south of the river
Biobio were taken and destroyed, the invasion was hurled back beyond
Concepcion, and the Spaniards were placed on the defensive.</p>

<p class="p2">The seventeenth century opened in Peru with a period of peace, during
which the system of government elaborated by the viceroy Toledo was to
be worked out to its consequences,&mdash;and in Chili, with the prospect of a
prolonged contest and an impoverished treasury. In both countries the
future of the native races was melancholy and without hope.</p>

<h3><a name="c563" id="c563">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE king of Spain instituted the office of historiographer of the Indies, and that post
was held for upwards of half a century by the learned Antonio de Herrera, who died
in 1625. All the official reports and correspondence were placed in his hands, and he had
the use of a great deal of material which is now lost; so that he is indispensable as an
authority.<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> His great work, <i>Historia General de las Indias Occidentales</i>, covers the whole
ground from 1492 to 1554, and is divided into eight decades, in strict chronological order.
The history of the conquest of Peru and of the subsequent civil wars is recorded with reference
to chronological order as bearing on events in other parts of the Indies, and not
connectedly. The work first appeared in 1601 and 1615, in five folio volumes, and was republished
in 1730. The English version by Stevens, in six octavo volumes (1725), is worthless.
The episode relating to the descent of the river Amazon by Francisco de Orellana
(<i>Herrera</i>, dec. vi. lib. ix.), was translated by Clements R. Markham, C. B., and printed for
the Hakluyt Society in 1859 as a part of the volume called <i>Expeditions into the Valley of
the Amazons</i>.</p>

<p>Francisco Lopez de Gomara was another compiler, who never personally visited Peru,
and is best known for his history of the conquest of Mexico. His narrative of the conquest
of Peru forms an important part of his work entitled <i>Historia de las Indias</i>. Although
he was a contemporary, and had peculiarly good opportunities for obtaining trustworthy
information, he was careless in his statements, and is an unsafe authority.<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a></p>

<p>Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés, born in 1478 of an old Asturian family, was an
eye-witness of the events on the isthmus which directly led to the discovery of Peru. He
went out with the governor Pedro Arias in 1513, and was at Panamá when Pizarro and
Almagro were fitting out their first expedition. He afterwards resided for many years in
Hispaniola, and at his death, in 1557, he was chronicler of the Indies, the predecessor of
Herrera. He was devoted to historical composition, interspersing his narrative with anecdotes
and personal reminiscences; but most of his works long remained in manuscript.
His two chapters on the conquest of Peru cover the ground from the landing of Pizarro to
the return of Almagro from Chili.<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, a relief to escape from compilers, and to be able to read the narratives
of the actual actors in the events they describe. The first adventurer who attempted to discover
Peru was the <i>adelantado</i> Pascual de Andagoya, and he has recorded the story of his
failures. Born of a good stock in the province of Alava, Pascual went out to Darien when
very young, with the governor Pedro Arias, in 1514. After the failure of his first attempt
he was in Panamá for some years, and in 1540 received the government of the country round
the Rio San Juan, the scene of Pizarro’s early sufferings. Here he founded the town of
Buenaventura; but having got into a dispute with Benalcazar respecting the boundaries of
their jurisdictions, Andagoya returned to Spain, where he remained five years. He accompanied
the president Gasca to Peru, and died at Cusco on the 18th of June, 1548. He had
broken his leg, but was recovering, when fever supervened, which carried him off. Gasca
reported that his death was mourned by all, because he was such a good man, and so zealous
in the service of his country. The historian Oviedo, who knew him well in the early
days of the Darien colony, speaks of Andagoya as a noble-minded and virtuous person.
He was a man of some education; and his humane treatment of the Indians entitles his
name to honorable mention. His interesting narrative long remained in manuscript at
Seville, but it was at length published by Navarrete.<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> An English translation,<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> by Clements

<p>Francisco de Xeres, the secretary of Pizarro, wrote his account of the early days of the
conquest of Peru on the spot, by order (March, 1533) of his master. He left Spain with
Pizarro in January, 1530, returned to Seville with the first instalment of gold from Caxamarca
in July, 1534; and his narrative, which embraces the period between these dates, was printed
at Seville in the same year.<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> This edition and that of 1547, printed somewhat carelessly at

by Clements R. Markham, C. B., was printed for the Hakluyt Society in 1872. There is a
freshness and reality in the story told by Xeres, owing to his having been an eye-witness
of all the events he describes, which the more elaborate accounts of compilers cannot
impart. Xeres has increased the value of his book by inserting the narrative of Miguel
Astete, who accompanied Hernando Pizarro on his expedition to Pachacamac.</p>

<p>Hernando Pizarro wrote a letter to the royal <i>Audiencia</i> of Santo Domingo, which
goes over the same ground as the narratives of Xeres and Astete, but is of course much
briefer. It is peculiarly valuable as containing the observations of the man of highest
rank in the expedition who was able to write.<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> The letter is dated November, 1533, and
was written on his way to Spain with the treasure. Oviedo gives it in his <i>Historic General</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a>
and it is printed by Quintana in his <i>Vidas de Españoles celebres</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> It was translated into
English by Clements R. Markham, C. B., and printed for the Hakluyt Society in 1872 in
the volume of <i>Reports on the Discovery of Peru</i>.</p>

<p>Pedro Sancho, the notary, wrote a note of the distribution of the ransom of Atahualpa,
with a list of the conquerors and the amount each received. It is contained in the inedited
work of Francisco Lopez de Caravantes, and was reprinted by Quintana in his <i>Vidas de
Españoles celebres</i>. An English translation by Clements R. Markham, C. B., was printed for
the Hakluyt Society in 1872, in the volume already cited. See also <i>Ramusio</i>, vol. iii. p.
414, for an Italian version, in which form it was used by Robertson and Prescott.<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a></p>

<p>Vicente de Valverde, the Dominican friar who accompanied Pizarro in the conquest
of Peru and took part in the imprisonment and murder of Atahualpa, was made bishop of
Cusco in 1536. On his way to Spain, in 1541, he landed on the island of Puna, in the Bay
of Guayaquil, was seized by the natives, and put to death with his brother-in-law and
twenty-six other Spaniards. He wrote a detailed <i>Carta-relacion</i> on the affairs of Peru,
which is still inedited. He also addressed letters to the emperor Charles V., which
contain original information of great value. A copy of one, dated Cusco, April 2, 1539,
was among Sir Thomas Phillipps’s collection of manuscripts. It is frequently quoted by
Helps.</p>

<p>Pedro Pizarro, a cousin of the conqueror, went out as his page in 1530, when only
fifteen. He was an eye-witness of all the events of the Conquest, and of the subsequent civil
wars, having retired to Arequipa after the assassination of his patron. Here he probably
wrote his <i>Relaciones del Descubrimiento y Conquista de los Reynos del Peru</i>, finished in
1571. It is a plain, unadorned statement of facts, but of the highest value as an authority.
It remained in manuscript for centuries, but was at length printed in the <i>Coleccion de
documentos inéditos para la historia de Espana</i>, v. 201-388.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a></p>

<p>The death-struggle between the Pizarros and the old marshal Almagro is fully told in
the above general histories; but light is also thrown upon the story from other directions.
Among the manuscripts in the National Library at Madrid<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> there is an autobiography by
a young scapegrace of noble birth named Alonzo Enriquez de Guzman, comprising a period
from 1518 to 1543, from his nineteenth to his forty-fourth year. The early part reminds
one of the adventures of Gil Blas; but in 1534 he went to Peru, and was a principal actor
in the events which took place between the departure of Almagro for Chili in 1535 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
his execution in 1538. Don Alonzo seems to have quarrelled with Hernando Pizarro
during the siege of Cusco, and warmly espoused the cause of Almagro, who made him
one of his executors. The latter portion of the autobiography, including a long letter to
the emperor on the conduct of Hernando Pizarro, is very interesting, while the frankness
of Don Alonzo’s confessions as regards his own motives is most entertaining. <i>The Life
and Acts of Don Alonzo Enriquez de Guzman</i> was translated and edited by Clements
R. Markham, C. B., and printed by the Hakluyt Society in 1862. It had up to this time
escaped notice.</p>

<p>The last years of the marquis Pizarro were occupied in laying out and building the
capital of Peru, and we are indebted to the researches of the learned Peruvian, Don
Manuel Gonzalez de la Rosa, for having discovered the most detailed account of the
founding and early history of Lima among the manuscripts in the Biblioteca Colombina
at Seville. The <i>Historia de la Fundacion de Lima</i> was written by the Jesuit Bernabé
Cobo between 1610 and 1629, and was first printed under the superintendence of Dr. De
la Rosa in the <i>Revista Peruana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p>The story of the murder of Pizarro is told in the general histories, and there are some
additional particulars in Montesinos. A very laudatory life of the marquis, which, however,
contains the results of original research, is contained in the <i>Varones Ilustres del
Nuevo Mundo</i>, by Fernando Pizarro y Orellana (Madrid, 1639). This work also contains
Lives of Pizarro’s brothers and of Almagro.<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a></p>

<p>But by far the best life of Pizarro, both as regards literary merit and conscientious
research, is contained in the <i>Vidas de Españoles Celebres</i> by Don Manuel Josef Quintana.<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>
Quintana also gives the texts of the original agreement (1526) between Pizarro, Almagro,
and Luque, and of the capitulation (July 26, 1529, at Toledo) between Queen Juana and
Pizarro. These documents are also given by Prescott in the Appendix to the second
volume of his <i>Conquest of Peru</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a></p>

<p>After the assassination of Pizarro, the licentiate Vaca de Castro, having defeated the
younger Almagro, succeeded as governor of Peru, and the history of his rule is told in his
own letters. The first is to the emperor, reporting his arrival at Santo Domingo, and is
very brief. The second, also to the emperor, is from Quito, and announces the assassination
of Pizarro and the rebellion of Almagro the lad. The third is addressed to the
emperor from Cusco, after the battle of Chupas, and is a straightforward statement of his
proceedings. The fourth is a long letter from Cusco to his wife on private affairs. There
is also a long letter on the revolt of young Almagro and the battle of Chupas from the
municipality of Cusco to the emperor. These letters are included in the great official
volume of <i>Cartas de Indias</i> published at Madrid in 1877, pp. 463-521. The <i>Vida y
elojio del licenciado Vaca de Castro, Gobernador del Peru</i>, was written by Antonio de
Herrera, the chronicler of the Indies.<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a></p>

<p>A good historian accompanied the ill-fated viceroy Blasco Nuñez de Vela to Lima.
Augustin de Zarate was comptroller of accounts for Castile, and was sent out with the first
viceroy to examine into the financial affairs of Peru. He collected notes and materials
during his residence at Lima, and began the compilation of a history from the discovery
by Pizarro to the departure of Gasca, when he returned to Spain. He had access
to the best official sources of information, and his work is not without value; but he was
strongly prejudiced, and his style is tedious and inelegant. He assigns as the reason for
not having begun his narrative in Peru, that Carbajal had threatened any one who should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
attempt to record his exploits. In the earlier portions he relied on the testimony of the
actors still living; but for the later part he was himself a spectator and actor. He had
not intended to publish it in his lifetime; but the commendation of the emperor, to whom
it was shown, induced him to depart from his purpose. The original manuscript of Zarate
is or was preserved at Simancas; and Muñoz has disclosed how the printed volume differs
considerably from it, in suppressing things too frankly stated, and in taking on a literary
flavor not in the draft. Muñoz supposed that Florian d’Ocampo performed this critical
office in passing the book through the press.<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> His <i>Historia del Descubrimiento y Conquista
de la Provincia del Peru</i> was printed at Antwerp in 1555,<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> and a folio edition
appeared at Seville in 1577;<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> but the best edition of Zarate is in the Barcia Collection,
vol. iii. It was included in 1853 in the <i>Biblioteca de Autores Españoles</i>, vol. xxvi.<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a></p>

<p>A more important narrative of the civil war, which ended with the death of the viceroy
Blasco Nuñez, was written by Pedro de Cieza de Leon, and has been recently published.
Cieza de Leon landed in South America when he was barely fifteen, in the year 1534, and
during his military service he conceived a strong desire to write an account of the strange
things that were to be seen in the new world. “Oftentimes,” he wrote, “when the other
soldiers were reposing, I was tiring myself by writing. Neither fatigue, nor the ruggedness
of the country, nor the mountains and rivers, nor intolerable hunger and suffering have
ever been sufficient to obstruct my two duties; namely, writing, and following my flag and
my captain without fault.” In 1547 he joined the president Gasca, and was present
at the final rout of Gonzalo Pizarro. He was many years in Peru, and he is certainly
one of the most important authorities on Ynca history and civilization, whether we consider
his peculiar advantages in collecting information, or his character as a conscientious
historian. He lived to complete a great work, but unfortunately only a small portion of
it has seen the light. The first and second parts of the Chronicle of Cieza de Leon have
been published, but they relate to Ynca civilization and are discussed in a chapter in the
first volume of the present work. The third part, treating of the discovery and conquest
of Peru by Pizarro, is inedited, though the manuscript is believed to have been preserved.
Part IV. was divided into five books relating the history of the civil wars of the conquerors.
Only the third book has been published in the <i>Biblioteca Hispano-Ultramarina</i>. It
was very ably edited by Don Márcos Jiménez de la Espada (Madrid, 1877), and is entitled
<i>La Guerra de Quito</i>. The volume begins with the departure of the viceroy Blasco
Nuñez de Vela from Spain, and consists of fifty-three chapters in the first part, the
concluding portion forming a subsequent volume.<a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a></p>

<p>The proceedings of the president, Pedro de la Gasca, were recorded by himself in
very full reports to the Council of the Indies, which almost amount to official diaries. The
first, dated at Santa Marta on his way out, July 12, 1546, has been published in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
official volume of <i>Cartas de Indias</i> (Madrid, 1877). Other published correspondence
throws light on the astute proceedings of the president while he was at Panamá. His
instructions to Lorenzo de Aldana, his letters to Gonzalo Pizarro, and the detailed report
of his agent Paniagua have been published in the <i>Revista de Lima</i>, 1880. His report to
the Council of the Indies, when on his way to attack Gonzalo Pizarro at Cusco (dated
Andahuaylas, March 7, 1548), has not been edited. But the Chilian historian Don Diego
Barros Arana has published<a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> the long despatch from Gasca to the Council, dated at
Cusco, May 7, 1548, in which he describes the rout of Sacsahuana, the executions of
Gonzalo Pizarro and Carbajal, and the subsequent bloody assize at Cusco. The document
frequently quoted by Prescott (in book v. chap. iii. of his history)<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> as <i>Relacion del
Licenciado Gasca MS.</i> is an abridged and mutilated copy of this despatch of May 7, 1548,
from the Muñoz Collection,<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a> and is preserved at Simancas. The sentence pronounced on
Gonzalo Pizarro is published in the <i>Revista Peruana</i> (1880), from the original manuscript
of Zarate’s Chronicle.<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> Gasca continues his narrative in the despatches to the Council,
dated at Lima, Sept. 25 and Nov. 26, 1548, which are also published by Barros Arana.<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>
There are six other despatches of the president from Lima, dated in 1549, in the <i>Cartas
de Indias</i>. The invaluable papers of the president Gasca are not in the Archives at
Seville, but have been preserved by his family.<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a></p>

<p>But the best-known historian of the period during which the president Gasca was in
Peru was Diego Fernandez de Palencia, usually called “el Palentino,” from the place
of his birth. He went out to Peru, served in the army which was raised to put down the
rebellion of Giron, and having collected materials for a history, he was appointed chronicler
of Peru by the viceroy Marquis of Cañete. Fernandez first wrote the history of
the rebellion of Giron, in the suppression of which he was personally engaged; and afterwards
he undertook to write a similar account of the rebellion of Gonzalo Pizarro and
the administration of Gasca. Fernandez is a very painstaking writer, and no history of
the time enters so fully into detail; yet it is pleasantly written, and the graver narrative is
frequently relieved by anecdotes of personal adventures, and by amusing incidents. He
is however a thorough-going partisan, and can see no redeeming feature in a rebellion,
nothing but evil in the acts of rebels. His book is called <i>Primera y Secunda Parte de la
Historia del Peru, que se mando escrebir á Diego Fernandez, vecino de la ciudad de
Palencia</i>. It was published at Seville in 1571 (folio; primera parte, pp. 142; segunda
parte, pp. 130). This is the only edition.<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a></p>

<p>The first part of the work of the Ynca Garcilasso de la Vega relates to the history
and civilization of the Yncas, and is discussed in the first volume of the present work.
But the second part is a general history of the discovery of Peru, and of the civil wars
down to the termination of the administration of the viceroy Toledo in Peru, and to the
death of the governor Loyola in Chili. Like the first part, the second is rather a commentary
than a history, for the Ynca quotes largely from other writers, especially from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
Palentino, always carefully indicating the quotations and naming the authors. But his
memory was well stored with anecdotes that he had heard when a boy; and with these he
enlivens the narrative, while often a recollection of the personal appearance or of some
peculiarity of the historical character whose deeds he is recording enables him to give a
finishing touch to a picture. His father was a conqueror and an actor in most of the
chief events of the time;<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a> his mother, an Ynca princess, and born in the city of Cusco;
so the future author had special advantages for storing up information. He was born
in 1539, but a few years after the conquest and one year after the death of Almagro.
He passed his school days at Cusco, with many other half-caste sons of the conquerors,
and went to Spain in 1560, dying at Cordova in 1616. The first part of his great work
on Peru originally appeared at Lisbon in 1609, the second part at Cordova in 1617. The
second and best edition of the two parts appeared at Madrid in 1723. The English translation
of Sir Paul Rycaut (1688) is worthless, and there has never been a complete English
version of the second part, which is entitled <i>Historia General del Peru</i>. The episode
of the expedition of Gonzalo Pizarro to the land of cinnamon (part ii. lib. iii.) was translated
by Clements R. Markham, C.B., and printed for the Hakluyt Society in 1859.<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a></p>

<p>The licentiate Fernando Montesinos is an authority of some reputation, but chiefly
valuable for his studies of native lore. He was altogether upwards of fifteen years in
Peru. He was there a century after the conquest. His <i>Memorias Antiguas Historiales</i>
exclusively relate to Ynca history; but his <i>Annales</i> contain a history of the conquest and
of subsequent events, and include some original documents, and a few anecdotes which
are not to be found elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The authorities for the final settlement of Peru, after the crushing of the spirit of
revolt by the Marquis of Cañete, are a good deal scattered. A learned account of the
life and administration of Andres Marquis of Cañete himself will be found in the admirable
<i>Diccionario Histórico-Biografico del Peru</i> by General Mendiburu, published at
Lima in 1880; which also contains a Life of his successor, the licentiate Lope Garcia
de Castro.</p>

<p>The viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo has left a deeper mark on the history of Peru
by his <i>Libro de Tasas</i> and <i>Ordenanzas</i> relating to mines and the treatment of Indians.
The transactions with reference to the judicial murder of Tupac Amaru and the persecution
of the Ynca family are briefly related by Garcilasso de la Vega; but there is a
much more detailed account in the <i>Coronica Moralizada del Orden de San Augustin en el
Peru</i> by Fray Antonio de la Calancha, published at Barcelona in 1638.<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> Calancha also
gives the remorseful will of Mancio Sierra de Leguizamo, whose life-story is fully related
by Don José Rosendo Gutierrez in the <i>Revista Peruana</i> (tomo ii. 1880).</p>

<p>The story of the capture and execution of Tupac Amaru by the viceroy Toledo is told
in very full detail by Baltasar d’Ocampo, who was an eye-witness. His narrative has all
the charm of honest truthfulness; and yet the incidents, thus simply related, are as interesting
as the most ingeniously constructed romance. Unfortunately the story, as told by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
Ocampo (<i>Descripcion de la Provincia de San Francisco de Villcapampa</i>), has never been
printed. It is among the manuscripts of the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a></p>

<p>Polo de Ondegardo, the learned lawyer, was the principal adviser of the viceroy
Toledo. He arrived in Peru before the president Gasca, and held the important posts of
<i>corregidor</i> of Potosi and of Cusco. He had a profound knowledge of the Ynca system
of government, and his two <i>Relaciones</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> addressed to the Marquis of Cañete and the
Conde de Nieva, discuss the land tenures, colonial policy, and social legislation of the
natives. His labors were all undertaken with a view to adapting the best parts of the
Ynca system to the new polity to be instituted by the Spanish conquerors; and his
numerous suggestions, from this standpoint, are wise and judicious. A feeling of sympathy
for the Indians, and the evidence of a warm desire for their welfare pervade all his
writings. There is another rough draft of a report by Polo de Ondegardo, a manuscript
in the National Library at Madrid,<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> which contains much information respecting the
administrative system of the Yncas; and here, also, he occasionally points out the way
in which native legislation might usefully be imitated by the conquerors. This report
of Polo de Ondegardo was translated by Clements R. Markham, C.B., and printed for
the Hakluyt Society in 1873 in the volume called <i>Rites and Laws of the Incas</i>. It is
believed that Polo de Ondegardo died at Potosi in about the year 1580.</p>

<p>The other adviser of the viceroy Toledo was a man of a very different character, a
hard, relentless politician, indifferent alike to the feelings and the physical well-being of
the conquered people. Judge Matienzo wrote a work in two parts on the condition of the
people, the <i>mita</i>, or forced labor, the tribute, the mining laws, and on the duties of the
several grades of Spanish officials. The <i>Gobierno de el Peru</i> of Matienzo is a manuscript
in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a></p>

<p>The whole body of ordinances and regulations relating to the aboriginal people and
their treatment by the conquerors is fully explained and discussed by Dr. Don Juan de
Solorzano, a profoundly learned jurist, and member of the Council of the Indies, in his
<i>Politica Indiana</i> (Madrid, 1648). The history of <i>encomiendas</i> in Peru is well and ably
discussed by Enrique Torres Saldamando in the <i>Revista Peruana</i> (vol. ii. 1880).<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a></p>

<p>The second Marquis of Cañete, who was viceroy of Peru in the last decade of the sixteenth
century, was best known for his conduct of the Araucanian war, when, as a young
man, he was governor of Chili. That famous war formed the subject of the epic poem of
Alonzo de Ercilla, the warrior-poet. Born at Bermeo on the shores of the Bay of Biscay,
where the house of his ancestors is still standing, Ercilla began life as a page to the prince
of Spain, and volunteered to go out and serve against the Araucanians, when news arrived
of an outbreak and the death of Valdivia. Born in 1533, he was only twenty-one when he
set out for Chili under the command of the youthful governor Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza.
Ercilla was present at seven regular battles, and suffered much from hardships during the
harassing campaigns. He returned to Spain in 1562, after an absence of eight years. His
Araucana<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> is a versified history of the war, in which he describes all the events in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
order, enumerates the contending chiefs, with a few lines to denote the character or special
characteristic of each, and is minutely accurate even in his geographical details. He tells
us that much of the poem was composed in the country, and that by the light of the camp-fires
at night he wrote down what had occurred during the day. Ticknor looks upon the
<i>Araucana</i> as an historical rather than an epic poem;<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> and he considers the descriptive
powers of Ercillo&mdash;except in relation to natural scenery&mdash;to be remarkable, the speeches
he puts in the mouths of Araucanian chiefs often excellent, and his characters to be drawn
with force and distinctness. Pedro de Oña, in his <i>Arauco Domado</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a> praises the governor,
Hurtado de Mendoza, the future Marquis of Cañete; and Lope de Vega made his Araucanian
war the subject of one of his plays.</p>

<p>The Life of the viceroy Marquis of Cañete (Garcia) was written by Don Cristóval
Suarez de Figueroa, a man of some literary fame in his day. When the marquis returned
from Peru broken in health, he was treated with neglect and ingratitude; nor had he
received full justice from Ercilla for his youthful exploits,&mdash;at least so thought his heirs
when he died in 1599; and they applied to Suarez de Figueroa to undertake his biography,
placing all the viceroy’s family and official papers in the author’s hands. The result was
the <i>Hechos de Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, cuarto Marques de Cañete</i>, which was
printed in 1613.<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> It was reprinted in the <i>Coleccion de Historiadores de Chile</i>,&mdash;a work
published in seven volumes at Santiago in 1864, edited by Don Diego Barros Arana. This
work contains a very full account of the administration of the marquis while he was viceroy
of Peru.</p>

<p>Pedro de Valdivia has written his own history of his conquest and settlement of Chili,
in his letters to the emperor, Charles V. They are preserved in the Archives at Seville
among the documents sent from Simancas, and have been published by Claudio Gaye in
his <i>Historia de Chile</i> (Paris, 1846), and also in the first volume of the <i>Coleccion de Historiadores
de Chile</i> (Santiago, 1864). The first of Valdivia’s despatches is dated from La
Serena, Sept. 4, 1545, and the second from Lima, June 15, 1548. In the third he reports
fully on the state of affairs in Chili, and refers to his own previous career. It is dated
from Concepcion, Oct. 15, 1550. There are two others, dated Concepcion, Sept. 25, 1551,
and Santiago, Oct. 26, 1552, which are short, and not so interesting.</p>

<p>Some discontented soldiers brought a series of fifty-seven accusations against Valdivia,
which were considered by the president Gasca at Lima in October, 1548,&mdash;the result
being acquittal. The <i>Acta de Accusacion</i> was published at Santiago in 1873 by Barros
Arana, together with Valdivia’s defence and several other important historical documents.
That accomplished Chilian historian has also edited a very interesting letter from Pedro
de Valdivia to Hernando Pizarro, dated at La Serena on the 4th of September, 1545, which
fell into the hands of the president Gasca, and remained among his papers; and when he
was at Seville in 1859, he discovered one more unimportant letter from the Chilian conqueror
to Charles V., dated at Santiago, July 9, 1549. The first book of the records of
the Santiago municipality, called the <i>Libro Becerro</i>, embraces the years from 1541 to 1557.
It has been published in the first volume of the <i>Coleccion de Historiadores de Chile</i>, etc.
(Santiago, 1861), and contains the appointment of Valdivia as governor of Chili, the founding
of Santiago, with the nomination of the first municipal officers, ordinances for mines,
and other important entries.</p>

<p class="p2">There is thus ample original material for the opening chapter of the history of Chili.
Moreover, the first connected work on the subject was written by one of the early conquerors.
Gongora Marmolejo served under Valdivia, and was an eye-witness of all the
stirring events of the time. His history begins at the discovery of Chili, in 1536, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
is brought down to the year 1575. Written in Santiago, it is addressed to the president
of the Council of the Indies; and though the style is confused, and often obscure, the
narrative has the merit of impartiality, and supplies many interesting details. It also has
annexed documents, including a letter from Gonzalo Pizarro to Valdivia giving an account
of events in Peru, down to the death of Blasco Nuñez de Vela. The <i>Historia de Chile</i> of
Gongora Marmolejo remained in manuscript in the Biblioteca de Salazar (H. 45) until it
was edited by Don Pascual de Gayangos, in 1850, for the fourth volume of the <i>Memorial
Histórico Español</i>. It has since been published in the <i>Coleccion de Historiadores de Chile</i>.</p>

<p>The story of the surprise and death of the governor, Martin Garcia de Loyola, and of
the subsequent formidable rising of the Araucanians in 1598, was written in the form of a
poem by Captain Fernando Alvarez de Toledo. The work has no literary merit, and is
only valuable as an historical narrative. The manuscript is in the National Library at
Madrid, and it was published by Don Diego Barros Arana, in the <i>Collection d’Ouvrages
inédits ou rares sur L’Amérique</i> (Paris, 1861). An interesting modern account of the
death of the governor Loyola, entitled <i>La sorpresa de Curalava</i>, was written by the
accomplished Chilian, Miguel Luis Amunátegui, and published as one of his <i>Naraciones
Históricas</i> (Santiago, 1876).<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a></p>

<p>The history of Chili, which follows Marmolejo in point of time, is by Cordova y Figueroa,
a native of the country, and a descendant of Juan de Negrete, one of the followers
of Valdivia. Cordova y Figueroa was born at Concepcion in 1692, served with credit in a
war with the Araucanians, and is believed to have written the history between 1740 and
1745. Beginning with the expedition of Almagro, it comes down to the year 1717, and
is the most complete history that had been written up to that date. The manuscript was
in the National Library at Madrid, and a copy was made for the Chilian government,
under the auspices of Don Francisco S. Astaburriaga, who was then minister to Spain.
It was published in the <i>Coleccion de Historiadores de Chile</i>.</p>

<p>In this review of works on the conquest and first settlement of Peru and Chili, those
which refer only to the history and civilization of the Yncas, or to geography and natural
history, have been omitted, as they receive notice in the chapter on ancient Peru in the
first volume of this History.</p>

<h3><a name="c573" id="c573">EDITORIAL NOTES.</a></h3>

<p><b>A.</b> <span class="smcap">Cieza de Leon.</span>&mdash;It does not seem desirable
to divide the bibliographical record of
Cieza de Leon between the present and the first
volume. His work was separated into four parts,&mdash;the
<i>first</i> relating to the geography and description
of Peru; the <i>second</i>, to the period of the Incas;
the <i>third</i>, to the Spanish Conquest; the
<i>fourth</i>, to the civil wars of the conquerors. The
fate of each part has been distinct.</p>

<p><b>Part I.</b> Prescott (<i>Peru</i>, vol. ii. p. 306)
speaks of this as more properly an itinerary or
geography of Peru, presenting the country in its
moral and physical relations as it appeared to
the eye of the conquerors; and not many of
them, it is probable, were so impressed as Cieza
de Leon was with the grandeur of the <i>cordilleras</i>.
This, as <i>Parte primera de la chronica del Peru</i>,
was published in folio at Seville, in 1553. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
Rich’s time (1832) it was worth £5 5<i>s.</i><a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a> It was
reprinted the next year (1554) at Antwerp in two
distinct editions. One, <i>La chronica del Peru</i>, in
duodecimo, has the imprint of Nucio; the other,
likewise in duodecimo, is printed in an inferior
manner, and sometimes has the name of Bellero,
and sometimes that of Steelsio, as publisher.
This last edition has the larger title, <i>Parte primera
de la chronica del Peru</i>, etc., and was the
one used by Prescott, and followed by Markham
in the translation, <i>Travels of Cieza de Leon</i>,
published by the Hakluyt Society in 1864.<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a></p>

<p>In 1555 an Italian translation, <i>La prima parte
de la cronica del ... Peru</i>, appeared at Rome,
made by Agostino Cravaliz, or Augustino di
Gravalis.<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> A second edition&mdash;<i>La prima parte
dell’istorie del Peru</i>&mdash;appeared the next year
(1556) at Rome, and is found with the names of
two different publishers.<a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a></p>

<p>At Venice, in 1560, appeared the <i>Cronica del
gran regno del Peru</i>. This makes a work of
which the first volume is a reprint of Gravaliz’
version of Cieza, and volumes ii. and iii. contain
an Italian version of Gomara in continuation
offered by the same publisher, Ziletti, under the
title, <i>La seconda, terza parte delle historie dell
India</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1536_1536" id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a></p>

<p>The English translation of Stevens (<i>The
Seventeen Years’ Travels of Peter de Cieza through
the mighty Kingdom of Peru and the large Provinces
of Cartagena and Popayan in South America,
from the City of Panama on the Isthmus to the
Frontiers of Chile</i>) was printed at London in 1709,
and appeared both separately and as a part of
his collection of <i>Voyages</i>. It gives only ninety-four
of the one hundred and nineteen chapters.</p>

<p><b>Part II.</b> Rich, though he had heard of this
part, supposed it to have disappeared; and it is
spoken of as missing by Markham in 1864, and
by Harrisse in his <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i> (p. 319).
The manuscript of it was meanwhile in the
Escurial, preserved in a bad copy made about
the middle or end of the sixteenth century; but
it is deficient in chapters i. and ii. and in part of
chapter iii. Another manuscript copy not well
done is in the Academy of History at Madrid.
Lord Kingsborough had a copy, and from this
Rich had a fifth copy made, which was used by
Prescott; but it does not appear that any of
these students suspected it to be the second
part of Cieza de Leon. Prescott, supposing it
to be written <i>by</i> the president of the Council of
the Indies, Sarmiento, instead of <i>for</i> that officer,
ascribed it to him; but Kirk, Prescott’s editor
(<i>Peru</i>, vol. ii. p. 308), has recognized its identity,
which Dr. Manuel Gonzales de la Rosa established
when he edited the Escurial manuscript
in 1873. This edition, though wholly printed in
London, has not been made public. Following
another transcript, and correcting the spelling,
etc., Márcos Jiménez de la Espada printed it at
Madrid in 1880 as vol. v. of the <i>Biblioteca Hispano-Ultramarina</i>.
An English translation of it
was made by Mr. Markham, and published by
the Hakluyt Society in 1883.</p>

<p><b>Part III.</b> Markham reports that Espada
says that this part is in existence, but inaccessible.</p>

<p><b>Part IV.</b> Espada is cited as asserting that
books i. and ii. of this part are in existence, but
inaccessible.</p>

<p>A manuscript of book iii. is in the Royal
Library at Madrid, in handwriting of the middle
of the sixteenth century. It covers the period
from the appointment of Blasco Nuñez as viceroy
in 1543 to a period just previous to Gasca’s
departure from Panamá for Peru in 1547. A
copy of this manuscript, belonging to Uguina,
passed to Ternaux, thence to Rich, who sold it
for £600 to Mr. Lenox; and it is now in the
Lenox Library.</p>

<p>It has since been included under Espada’s
editing in the <i>Biblioteca Hispano-Ultramarina</i>,
and was published at Madrid in 1877 as <i>Tercero
libro de las Guerras Civiles del Peru</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1537_1537" id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a></p>

<p>Books iv. (war of Huarina) and v. (war of
Xaquixaguana), and two appended commentaries
on events from the founding of the <i>Audiencia</i> to
the departure of the president, and on events
extending to the arrival of the viceroy Mendoza,
are not known to exist, though Cieza refers to
them as written. These would complete the
fourth part, and end the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<p>What we know of Cieza is mainly derived
from himself and the brief notice in Antonio’s
<i>Bibliotheca Hispana Nova</i> (Madrid, 1788). The
writer of the foregoing chapter gives an account
of Cieza’s career, as well as it could be made out,
in his translation of the <i>Travels</i>; but he supplements
that story in the introduction to his version
of Part II.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Garcilasso de la Vega.</span>&mdash;The <i>Primera
parte de los Commentarios reales</i> seems to have
been printed&mdash;according to the colophon at
Lisbon&mdash;in 1608, but to have been published
in 1609. It has incidental notices of Spanish-American
history, though concerned mainly
with chronicles of the Incas.<a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a></p>

<p>The second part, called <i>Historia General del
Peru</i>, was printed at Cordova in 1616, though
most copies are dated 1617. The titles of the
two dates slightly vary. This volume is of
larger size than that of 1609.<a name="FNanchor_1539_1539" id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a></p>

<p>The two parts were reprinted by Barcia at
Madrid in 1722-1723.<a name="FNanchor_1540_1540" id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> There have been later
editions of the Spanish at Madrid in 1800, and
in 1829, in four volumes, as a part of a series;
<i>Conquista del Nuevo Mondo</i>, in nine volumes,
which embraced also Solis’s Mexico, Garcilasso
de la Vega’s Florida, and the Florida of Cardenas
y Cano.</p>

<p>Rycaut’s English <i>Royal Commentaries of
Peru</i> (London, 1688) was priced by Rich (no.
420) in 1832 at £1 4<i>s.</i>, and is not worth more
now.<a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> Markham’s English version of the first
part was issued in two volumes by the Hakluyt
Society in 1869-1871.</p>

<p>The French version (by J. Baudoin) of the
first part was printed at Paris in 1633 as <i>Le
Commentaire Royal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> and of the second part as
<i>Histoire des Guerres Civiles</i> in 1650, and again
in 1658 and 1672,<a name="FNanchor_1543_1543" id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> and at Amsterdam in 1706.<a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a>
A French version of the first part was also
printed at Amsterdam in 1715,<a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a> and joined with
the book on Florida; another French edition
appeared at Amsterdam in 1737.<a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> A new translation

There was a German translation in 1798.</p>

<p>An account of Garcilasso de la Vega and
his ancestry is given by Markham in the introduction
to his version of the <i>Royal Commentaries
of the Yncas</i>. Another account is in the <i>Documentos
inéditos (España)</i>, vol. xvi.<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a></p>

<p>The estimate held of him by Robertson has
been largely shared among the older of the
modern writers, who seem to think that Garcilasso
added little to what he borrowed from
others, though we find some traces in him of
authorities now lost. The later writers are more
generous in their praise of him. Prescott quotes
him more than twice as often as he cites any
other of the contemporary sources. (Cf. his
<i>Peru</i>, vol. i. p. 289.)</p>

<p>Helps says that “with the exception of
Bernal Diaz and Las Casas, there is not perhaps
any historical writer of that period, on the
subject of the Indies, whose loss would be more
felt than that of Garcilasso de la Vega.”</p>

<p>Ternaux-Compans in his <i>Voyages</i> has preserved
in a French version several early chronicles
of minor importance. Such is Miguel
Carello Balbóa’s <i>Histoire du Peru</i> (in vol. xvii.),
the work of one who went to Bogota in 1566,
and finished his work at Quito in 1586. It
rehearses the story of the Inca rule, not always
agreeing with Garcilasso, and only touches the
Spanish Conquest as it had proceeded before
the murder of Atahualpa.<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> Another work is
the <i>Histoire du Pérou</i> of Father Anello Oliva,
a Jesuit, who was born at Naples in 1593, came
to Peru as a Jesuit in 1597, and died at Lima
in 1642. It was apparently written before 1631;
but what Ternaux affords us is only the first of
the four books which constitute the completed
work.<a name="FNanchor_1561_1561" id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a> Juan de Velasco’s <i>Histoire de Quito</i>, a

<p>Alonso de Ovalle’s historical account of
Chili was issued at Rome in 1646, in Italian, as
<i>Historica Relatione del Regno di Cile</i>, and the
same year at the same place in Spanish, as <i>Histórica
Relacion del Reyne de Chile</i>. Six of the

<p>Among the minor documentary sources there
is much of interest to be found in the <i>Documentos

and li.</p>

<p>The Ministerio de Fomento of Peru printed
at Madrid in 1881 the first volumes&mdash;edited by
Jiménez de la Espada&mdash;of <i>Relaciones geográficas
de Indias</i>. The editor supplied a learned introduction,
and the volume contained twelve documents
of the sixteenth century, which were then
published for the first time;<a name="FNanchor_1563_1563" id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> and they contribute
to our knowledge of the condition of the
country during that period.</p>

<p>There are other documents covering the whole
course of Peruvian history in the collection of
<i>Documentos históricos del Peru en las epocas del
coloniage despues de la conquista y de la independencia
hasta a presente, colectados y arreglados por
el coronel Manuel Odriozola</i>, the first volume of
which was published at Lima about twenty-five
years ago (1863).</p>

<p>Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, pp. 320-322) enumerates
many copies of manuscripts preserved
in New York and Boston, some of which have
since been printed. There is record of other

unprinted manuscript containing the military
Lives of Pedro Alvarez de Holguin and Martin
de Almendral (Almendras), consisting of depositions
respecting their services by eye-witnesses,
taken in pursuance of a claim by their families
for the possession of titles and property, their
ancestors having been among the conquerors.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous writers upon Peruvian
history in English are Prescott, Helps, and
Markham,&mdash;the first two as the historians of
the Conquest, and the third as an annotator of
the original sources and an elucidator of controverted
points. Prescott’s <i>Conquest of Peru</i>
was published in 1843. He had been fortunate
enough to secure copies from the manuscript
stores which Muñoz had gathered, and Navarrete
allowed his collections to be gleaned for
the American’s use. He did not fail of the
sympathy and support of Ternaux and of Gayangos.
The ingenious and active assistance of
Obadiah Rich secured him a good share of the
manuscripts of the Kingsborough Collection
when that was scattered. The <i>Conquest of Peru</i>
was promptly translated into Spanish, and
published at Madrid in 1847-1848; and again in
a version supposed to have been made by
Icazbalceta. It was printed at Mexico in 1849.
A French translation was introduced to the
world by Amédée Pichot, and the English on
the continent were soon able to read it in their
own tongue under a Paris imprint. The Dutch
and German people were not long without
versions in their vernaculars. Since Mr. Prescott’s
death the revision, which the American
reader was long kept from (owing to the obstructions
to textual improvements imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
by the practice of stereotyping), was made by
Mr. Kirk, who had been Prescott’s secretary;
and the new edition, with that gentleman’s elucidatory
and corrective notes, appeared at Philadelphia
in 1874.</p>

<p>As was the case with the hero of Mexico,
the chapters in Helps’s <i>Spanish Conquest</i> on the
conqueror of Peru have, since the publication
of that book, been extracted and fitted newly
together under the title of <i>The Life of Pizarro,
with some account of his Associates in the Conquest
of Peru</i>, published in London in 1869.
Pizarro is not, under Helps’s brush, the abhorrent
figure of some other historians. “He is
always calm, polite, dignified,” he says. “He
was not one of the least admirable of the conquerors.”</p>

<p>Mr. Markham, referring to a visit which he
made to Prescott, says: “He it was who encouraged
me to undertake my Peruvian investigations
and to persevere in them. To his kindly
advice and assistance I owe more than I can
say, and to him is due, in no small degree, the
value of anything I have since been able to do
in furtherance of Peruvian research.” The
first fruit of Mr. Markham’s study was his
<i>Cusco and Lima</i> in 1856. Three years later
(1859) he was sent by the British Government
to superintend the collection of cinchona plants
and seeds (quinine) in Peru, and to introduce
them into India. In pursuit of this mission, he
formed the acquaintance with the country which
was made public in his <i>Travels in Peru and
India</i> in 1862. In 1880 he epitomized his great
knowledge in a useful little handbook on <i>Peru</i>,
which was published in London in the series of
<i>Foreign Countries and British Colonies</i>. His
greatest aid to the historian has come, however,
from the annotations given by him to numerous
volumes of the Hakluyt Society, which he has
edited, and in his communications to the <i>Journal
of the Royal Geographical Society</i>.</p>

<p>The Peruvian story is but an incidental feature
of Hubert H. Bancroft’s <i>Central America</i>,
where Alvarado’s report of May 12, 1535, and
other documents which fell into that author’s
hands with the Squier manuscripts afford in part
the basis of his narrative, vol. ii. chap. vii. Bancroft
accounts Pizarro himself the most detestable
man in the Indies after Pedrárias. He collates
the authorities on many disputed points, and is
a valuable assistant, particularly for the relations
of operations on the isthmus to those in Peru,&mdash;such
as the efforts of Gonzalo Pizarro to make
the isthmus the frontier of his Peruvian government,
and Gasca’s method of breaking through
it. In his chapter on “Mines and Mining” in
his <i>Mexico</i> (vol. iii.) he incidentally recapitulates
the story of the wealth which was extracted
from Peru.</p>

<p>The dignified and well-balanced story as told
in Robertson’s <i>America</i> (book vi.) is not without
use to-day, and his judgment upon authorities
(note cxxv.) is usually sound. He has of course
fallen behind that sufficiency which Dr. Smyth
found in him, when he gave his <i>Lectures on
Modern History</i> (lecture xxi.). The latter writer
reflected an opinion not yet outgrown when he
says that “Pizarro was, after all, a vulgar conqueror,
and is from the first detested, though he
seizes upon our respect, and retains it in defiance
of ourselves, from the powerful and decisive nature
of his courage and of his understanding.”</p>

<p>The latest English summarized view of the
Conquest will be found in R. G. Watson’s <i>Spanish
and Portuguese South America during the
Colonial Period</i> (London, 1884). The author lived
in South America about twenty years ago, in
various parts, as a diplomatic agent of the
English government.</p>

<h3><a name="c579" id="c579">THE</a></h3>

<p class="pc1 large">AMAZON AND ELDORADO.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE EDITOR.</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">IN 1528, in order to follow up the explorations of Ojeda and others on the coast of
Venezuela the Emperor had agreed with the great German mercantile house of the Velsers
to protect a colony to be sent by them to found cities and to mine on this northern coast.<a name="FNanchor_1567_1567" id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a>
This was the origin of the expedition led by Ambrosio de Alfinger to find a fabulous golden
city, of which reports of one kind and another pervaded the Spanish settlements along
the coast. It was in 1530 that Alfinger started inland. This march produced the usual
story of perfidy and cruelty practised upon the natives, and of attack and misery experienced
by the invaders. Alfinger died on the way, and after two years (in 1532) what was left of
his followers found their way back to the coast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an expedition inland had started under Diego Ordaz in 1531, by way of the
Orinoco; but it had failed, its leader being made the victim of a mutiny. One of his officers,
Martinez, being expelled from the force for misbehavior, wandered away until he fell into the
hands of people who blindfolded him and led him a great way to a city, where the bandage
was removed from his eyes. Here they led him for a day and night through its streets till
they came to the palace of Inga their Emperor, with whom being handsomely entertained he
stayed eight months, when, being allowed to return, he came down the Orinoco to Trinidad,
and thence to Porto Rico, where, when dying, he told this tale of Manoa, as he called the city.
He was the first, the story goes, to apply the name of Eldorado to the alluring kingdom
in the depths of the continent. This is the pretended story as Raleigh sixty years later
learned from a manuscript which Berreo the Governor of Trinidad showed to him.<a name="FNanchor_1568_1568" id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a></p>

<p>Again, the Germans made another attempt to penetrate the country and its mystery.
George of Spires, under the imperial sanction, coming from Spain with four hundred men,
started inland from Coro in 1534. He succeeded in penetrating about fifteen hundred
miles, and returned with the survivors in 1538.</p>

<p>A lieutenant had played him false. Nicolaus Federmann<a name="FNanchor_1569_1569" id="FNanchor_1569_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a> had been disappointed in not
getting the command of the expedition, but being made second, was instructed to follow
after his chief with supplies. Federmann avoided making a junction with George, and
wandered at the head of about two hundred men, who were faithful to him, seeking glory
on his own account, till after three years of labor he emerged in April, 1539, from the
mountain passes upon the plains of Bogotá. Two years before this (in 1537) Gonzalo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
Ximenes Quesada, following up the Magdalena River, had arrived on the same plateau, and
completed the conquest of New Granada. The year following (1538), Sebastian de
Belalcazar, marching north from Quito, had reached the same point.<a name="FNanchor_1570_1570" id="FNanchor_1570_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">QUESADA.</p>
         <p class="pf400">Cf. Markham’s <i>Travels of Cieza de Leon</i>,
p. 110; and his <i>Narrative of Andagoya</i>, p. xxv.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus the three explorers from three directions came together. They joined forces and
descended the Magdalena to Santa Martha, where Pedro Fernandez de Lugo, the associate
of Quesada, died, while Quesada himself proceeded to Spain to obtain the government of
the newly discovered region. Meanwhile Hernan Perez, a brother of Quesada, being left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
in command in Bogotá, committed the usual cruel excesses upon the Chibchas, but finally
left them, to follow another adventurer who had arrived in the track of Federmann, with the
same stories of the golden city. So the recreant Governor joined the new-comer Montalvo
de Lugo, and together they marched eastward on their golden quest. He returned to Bogotá
in a year’s time, wiser but not happier.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a new expedition was forming on the Venezuela side. Among the followers
of George of Spires had been one Philip von Huten,<a name="FNanchor_1571_1571" id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a> who after George’s death, and when
Rodrigo Bastidas had succeeded him, was made the commander of an expedition which left
Coro in 1541 by vessels, and, prepared for an inland march, landed at Barburata. The
next spring he got on the track of Quesada and resolved to follow it; but the expedition
only journeyed in a circle, and after suffering all sorts of hardships found itself at the point
of setting out. Huten, undaunted, again started with a smaller force. He encountered and
made friends of the Uaupe Indians, and under their guidance proceeded against the towns
of the Omaguas, where they encountered resistance; and Huten being wounded, the
invaders retreated, and brought to an end another search for Eldorado. The expedition
had added a new synonym, Omaguas, for the attractive lure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">SKETCH MAP, AMAZON AND ELDORADO.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Huten, on his return to Coro, found that Carbajal had seized the government. This brutal
soldier now executed Huten, and held his iniquitous sway until the licentiate Juan Perez
de Tolosa arrived with the imperial authority in 1546, when Carbajal was in turn put to death.
Thus ended the German efforts at South American discovery on this side of the continent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gonzalo Ximenes Quesada’s visit to Spain had failed in making him the
Governor of New Granada, as he had hoped. Luis Alonzo de Lugo, the son of Quesada’s
associate, was the successful applicant for the position. The new Governor arrived in
1542, but a <i>residencia</i> interrupted his career, and Pedro de Ursua, a nephew of Armendariz,
the judge who had taken the <i>residencia</i>, was sent to Bogotá to take charge. Thence
his patron sent him on the old quest for the rivers flowing over golden sands. He failed
to find Eldorado; but he founded the city of Pampluna in the wilds, and ruled its stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
lots for two years. Then Armendariz had his downfall in turn, and Pedro de Ursua in
1549 found favor enough with those who then administered the government to get command
of another expedition to Eldorado, during which he founded another city, which
he had to abandon in 1552 because the natives attacked it so persistently. Next, Pedro
was put in command of Santa Martha, and began to fight the Indians thereabout; but
seeking a larger field, he started for Peru. His fame was sufficient to induce the
authorities at Panamá to engage him to quell the Cimarrones, who infested the Isthmus.
In two years Ursua accomplished this task, and then went on to Peru, where at Lima, in
1559, the new viceroy Cañete appointed him to lead a well-equipped expedition to Eldorado
and the Omaguas. If the fabled city should not be reached, the quest for it would
draw away from Cañete’s province the prowling ruffians whom the cessation of the civil
wars had left among the settlements. But it was thought the quest was more likely to be
successful than any previous one had been, since Viraratu, a coast chieftain of Brazil, had
with two Portuguese recently ascended the Amazon, and had confirmed to Cañete the old
stories of a hidden lake and its golden city.</p>

<p>Pedro de Ursua started in boats down the Huallaga to the Marañon, and so on to the
neighborhood of Machiparo. At this point, on New Year’s day, 1561, conspirators murdered
Ursua, threw off allegiance to Spain, and made Fernando de Guzman their sovereign.
One Lope de Aguirre was the leader of the insurrection, and it was not long
before Guzman paid the penalty of his life in turn, and Aguirre became supreme. The
conspirators went on to the mouth of the Negro, but from this point authorities differ as
to their course. Humboldt and Southey supposed they still kept to the Amazon until
they reached the sea. Acuña, Simon, Acosta, and among the moderns Markham,
suppose they ascended the Negro, crossed by the Cassiquiari canal to the Orinoco, and
so passed on to the ocean; or if not by this route, by some of the rivers of Guiana. Mr.
Markham<a name="FNanchor_1572_1572" id="FNanchor_1572_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a> balances the testimony. Once on the ocean, at whatever point, Aguirre steered
his vessels for the north and west till they came to the island of Margarita, then colonized
by the Spanish. Having seized this settlement, Aguirre led his followers across the intervening
waters to Venezuela, with the aim of invading and conquering New Granada; but
in due time a Spanish force led by Gutierrez de la Peña confronted the traitor and his
host, and overthrew them. Many of Aguirre’s men had deserted him; when killing his
own daughter, that she might not survive to be stigmatized as a traitor’s child, he was set
upon and despatched by his conquerors.</p>

<p>The earliest account of the expedition of Ursua and Aguirre is a manuscript in the
Royal library at Madrid written by one of the company, Francisco Vasquez, who remained
with Aguirre under protest till he reached Margarita. Vasquez’s story was a
main dependence of Pedro Simon, in the sixth of the <i>Primera parte de las Noticias
historiales de las Conquistas de Tierra Firme en las Indias Occidentales</i>, published at
Cuenca in 1627. Simon, who was born in Spain in 1574, had come to Bogotá in 1604,
in time to glean much from men still living. After many years of gathering notes, he
began to write his book in 1623. Only one part, which included the affairs of Venezuela
and the expedition of Ursua and Aguirre, was printed. Two other parts are in existence;
and Colonel J. Acosta, in his <i>Compendio histórico del descubrimiento y colonizacion de la
Nueva Granada en el siglo décimo sexto</i>, published at Paris in 1848, made use of them, and
says they are the most valuable recital of the sixteenth century in existence which relates
to these regions.<a name="FNanchor_1573_1573" id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> The account of Simon, so far as it relates to the expedition of Ursua,
has been translated by William Bollaert, and properly annotated by Mr. Markham; it
constitutes the volume published by the Hakluyt Society in 1861, called <i>The Expedition
of Pedro de Ursua and Lope de Aguirre in search of Eldorado and Omagua in 1560-1561</i>.
It has a map which marks the alternative courses of Aguirre.<a name="FNanchor_1574_1574" id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a></p>

found the second and third parts, printed there for the first time. The text is there
edited by Buenaventura Carlos Aribau. Ercilla has recorded his opinion of the faithfulness
of Castellanos, but Colonel Acosta thinks him inexact. These second and third
parts recount the adventures of the Germans in their search for Eldorado, and record
the conquests of Cartagena by Lugo, of Popayan by Belalcazar, and of Antischia. A
fourth part, which gave the conquest of New Granada, though used by Piedrahita, is
no longer known.</p>

<p>Castellanos could well have derived his information, as he doubtless did, from men
who had made part of the exploits which he celebrates; and as regards the mad pranks
of Aguirre, such is also the case with another contemporary account, preserved in the
National Library at Madrid, which was written by Toribio de Ortiguera, who was at
Nombre de Dios in 1561, and sent forces against Aguirre when that conspirator was on
his Venezuela raid. The story written from the survivors’ recitals does not materially
differ from that of Vasquez. He gives also a short account of the expedition of Gonzalo
Pizarro and Orellana, later to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Lucas Fernandez Piedrahita was a native of Bogotá, and, like Garcilasso de la Vega,
had the blood of the Incas in his veins. He became a priest, and was successively Bishop
of Santa Martha and of Panamá, and after having lived a life of asceticism, and been at
one time a captive of the buccaneers, he died at Panamá in 1688, at the age of seventy. He
depended chiefly in his <i>Historia General de las Conquistas del nuevo Reyno de Granada</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1576_1576" id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a>
on the <i>Compendio</i> of Ximenes de Quesada, no longer known, the Elegias of Castellanos,
and the Noticia of Simon. He borrows liberally from Simon, and says but little of Aguirre
till he lands in Venezuela. Aguirre’s career in the <i>Historia de la Conquista y poblacion
de Venezuela</i> of Oviedo y Baños is in like manner condensed from Simon, and is confined
also to his final invasion of the main. The book is rare, and Markham says that in 1861
even the British Museum had no copy.<a name="FNanchor_1577_1577" id="FNanchor_1577_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a> The general historians, De la Vega, Herrera,
and Acosta, give but scant accounts of the Ursua expedition. Markham<a name="FNanchor_1578_1578" id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> points out the
purely imaginative additions given to Aguirre’s story in Gomberville’s translation of
Acuña, misleading thereby not a few later writers. Much the same incorrectness characterizes
the recitals in the <i>Viage</i> of the Ulloas, in Velasco’s <i>Historia de Quito</i> (1789).</p>

<p class="p2">The faithlessness of Orellana and his fifty followers in deserting Gonzalo Pizarro in 1540,
while this leader was exploring the forests of the Cinnamon country, is told in another place.
Orellana, as has been said, was sent forward in an improvised bark to secure food for
Pizarro’s famished followers, but was tempted to pursue the phantom of golden discovery.
This impulse led him to follow the course of the river to the sea. It gave him the distinction
of being the discoverer of the weary course of the great Amazon. In his intercourse
with some of the river Indians he heard or professed to hear of a tribe of women warriors
whom it was easy, in recognition of the classic story, to name the Amazons. At one of
the native villages on the river the deserters built themselves a stancher craft than they
had escaped in; and so they sailed on in a pair of adventurous barks, fighting their way
past hostile villages, and repelling attacks of canoes, or bartering with such of the Indians
as were more peaceful. In one of the fights, when Orellana landed his men for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
conflict, it is affirmed that women led the native horde. From a prisoner they got signs
which they interpreted to mean that they were now in the region of the female warriors, and
not far from all the fabled wealth of which they were in search. But the marks of the tide
on the banks lured them on with the hope of nearing the sea. They soon got unmistakable
signs of the great water, and then began to prepare their frail crafts for encountering
its perils. They made sails of their cloaks. On the 26th of August they passed into
the Atlantic. They had left the spot where the river Napo flows into the Amazon on the
last day of December, 1541; and now, after a voyage of nearly eight months, they spread
their sails and followed the coast northward. The vessels parted company one night, but
they reached the island of Cubagua within two days of each other. Here they found a
Spanish colony, and Orellana was not long in finding a passage to Spain. The story he
had to tell was a thrilling one for ears eager for adventure, and a joyous one for such
as listened for the tales of wealth. Orellana might be trusted to entrap both sorts of
listeners.</p>

<p>The King was the best of listeners. He gave Orellana a commission to conquer these
fabulous countries, and in May, 1544, Orellana sailed with four ships and four hundred
men. Misfortune followed him speedily, and only two of his vessels reached the river.
Up they went for a hundred leagues or so; but it was quite different making headway
against the current from floating down it, as he had done before. His men died; his
vessels were stranded or broken up; he himself became ill, and at last died. This ended
the attempt; and such of his followers as could, made their way back to Spain; and New
Andalusia, as the country was to be named, remained without a master.</p>

<p>Of the expedition of Gonzalo Pizarro there is no account by any one engaged in it;
but we have the traditions of the story told by Garcilasso de la Vega in the second part,
book third, of the <i>Royal Commentaries</i>, and this account is put into English and annotated
by Mr. Markham in the <i>Expeditions into the Valley of the Amazons</i>, published by the
Hakluyt Society in 1859,&mdash;and to this book its editor contributes a summary of the later
explorations of the valley. Orellana’s desertion and his experiences are told by Herrera
in his <i>Historia General</i>; and this, which Markham calls the best account possessed by
us, is also translated by him in the same publication. Wallace, in his <i>Amazon and Rio
Negro</i>, has of late years suggested that the woman-like apparel of the men, still to be found
among the tribes of the upper Amazon, gave rise to the belief in the story of the female
warriors.<a name="FNanchor_1579_1579" id="FNanchor_1579_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The form which the story of Eldorado oftener took, and which it preserved for many
years, gave representation of a large inland sea, called finally Parima, and of a golden city
upon it called Manoa, the reminiscences of Martinez’s tale. Somehow, as Mr. Markham
thinks, these details were evolved in part out of a custom prevalent on the plains of
Bogotá, where a native chief is said to have gilded himself yearly, and performed some
rites in a large lake. All this array of wealth was clustered, in the imagination of the
conquerors of northern Peru, about the fabled empire of the Omaguas; and farther south
the beckoning names were Paytiti and Enim. Whatever the names or details, the inevitable
greed for gold in the mind of the Spanish invaders was quite sufficient to evolve the
phantom from every impenetrable region of the New World. In 1566 Martin de Proveda
followed in the track of Ursua; but sweeping north, his men dropped by the way, and a
remnant only reached Bogotá. He brought back the same rumors of rich but receding
provinces.</p>

<p>In 1568 the Spanish Government mapped out all this unknown region between two
would-be governors. Pedro Malaver de Silva was to have the western part, and Diego<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
Fernando de Cerpa to have the eastern as far as the mouths of the Orinoco. Both
of the expeditions which these ambitious heroes led came to nothing beyond their due
share of trials and aimless wandering; and one of the leaders, Silva, made a second
attempt in 1574, equally abortive, as the one survivor’s story proved it to be.</p>

<p>Markham says that the last expedition to achieve any important geographical discovery
was that of Antonio de Berreo in 1582. He had received by right the adventurous
impulse, through his marriage with the daughter or heiress of Gonzalo Ximenes de
Quesada. He followed down the Cassanare and the Meta, and pursued the Orinoco to its
mouth. The English took up the quest when Raleigh sent Jacob Whiddon in 1594 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
explore the Orinoco. Berreo, who was now the Spanish governor of Trinidad, threw what
obstacles in the way he could; and when Raleigh arrived with his fleet in 1595, the English
leader captured the troublesome Spaniard, and was confirmed in his belief, by what Berreo
told him, that he could reach the goal. This lure was the lying account of Juan Martinez,
already mentioned. The fortunes of Raleigh have been told elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a> and the expeditions
which he conducted or planned, says Markham, may be said to close the long roll
of searches after the fabulous Eldorado.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of the northern parts of South America had now been thridded by
numerous adventuring parties, but without success in this fascinating search. There still
remained an unknown region in Central Guiana, where were plains periodically inundated
by the overflow of the Rupununi, Essequibo, and Branco (Parima) rivers. Here must
Eldorado be; and here the maps, shortly after this, placed the mysterious lake and its
auriferous towers of Manoa down to a comparatively recent time. According to Humboldt<a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a>
and Schomburgk,<a name="FNanchor_1582_1582" id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> it was after the return of Raleigh’s and Keymis’s expedition
that Hondius was the first in his <i>Nieuwe Caerte van het goudreyke landt Guiana</i> (1599),<a name="FNanchor_1583_1583" id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a>
to introduce the Laguna Parima with its city Manoa in a map. He placed it between
1° 45´ and 2° north latitude, and made it larger than the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>We find the lake also in the <i>Nieuwe Wereldt</i> of De Laet in 1630, and in the editions of
that year in other languages. Another Dutch geographer, Jannson, also represented it.
Sanson, the French geographer, puts it one degree north of the equator in his <i>Terre Ferme</i>
in 1656, and is particular enough to place Manoa at the northwest corner of a squarish
inland sea; but he omits it in his chart of the Amazons in 1680. We find the lake again
in Heylin’s <i>Cosmographie</i> of 1663, and later editions; in Blaeu’s <i>Atlas</i> in 1685. Delisle
omits the lake in 1703, but gives a legend in French, as Homann does in his map in Latin,
“In hac regione aliqui ponunt lacum Parima urbemque Manoa del Dorado.” In another
of Delisle’s maps a small lake appears with the legend: “Guiane proprement dite ou
Dorado, dans laquelle quelques-uns mettent le lac Parime.” We have it again in the map
in Herrera, edition of 1728; and in 1729. Moll, the English geographer, likewise shows
it. In the middle of the century (1760) the maps of Danville preserve the lake, though he
had omitted it in an earlier edition; and the English edition, improved by Bolton in 1755,
still continues it, as does an Italian edition (Venice) in 1779. The original Spanish of
Gumilla’s <i>El Orinoco</i> (2d edition, Madrid, 1745) has a map which gives the lake, and it is
repeated in the French edition at Avignon in 1758, and in a later Spanish one at Barcelona
in 1781. Kitchen’s map, which was prepared for Robertson’s <i>History of America</i>,
again shows it; and it is in the centre of a great water system in the large map of La
Cruz, made by order of the King of Spain in 1775, which was re-engraved in London the
same year. It is also represented in the maps in the <i>Historia de la nueva Andalucia</i>, of
Antonio Caulin,<a name="FNanchor_1584_1584" id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> Madrid, 1779, and in the <i>Saggio di Storia Americana</i>, Rome, 1780.
Conrad Mannert’s map, published at Nuremberg in 1803, gives it; as do the various editions
of François Depons’ <i>Voyage dans l’Amerique méridionale</i>, Paris, 1806. The lake
here is given under thirty degrees north latitude, and Manoa is put at the northeast corner
of it.</p>

<p>The same plate was used for the English version “by an American gentleman,”
published in New York in 1806; while the translation published in London in 1807,
apparently the same with a few verbal changes, has a like configuration on a map of reduced
scale. One of the latest preservations of the myth is the large map published in London
by Faden in 1807, purporting to be based on the studies of D’Arcy de la Rochette, where
the inland sea is explained by a legend: “Golden Lake, or Lake Parime, called likewise
Parana Pitinga,&mdash;that is, White Sea,&mdash;on the banks of which the discoverers of the
sixteenth century did place the imaginary city of Manoa del Dorado.” I have seen it
in German maps as late as 1814, and the English geographer, Arrowsmith, kept it in
his maps in his day.<a name="FNanchor_1585_1585" id="FNanchor_1585_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a></p>

<p>It was left for Humboldt to set the seal of disbelief firmly upon the story.<a name="FNanchor_1586_1586" id="FNanchor_1586_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> Schomburgk
says that the inundations of extensive savannas during the tropical winter gave rise, no
doubt, to the fable of the White Sea, assisted by an ignorance of the Indian language.
Nevertheless, as late as 1844, Jacob A. van Heuvel, in his <i>Eldorado, being a Narrative of
the Circumstances which gave rise to Reports in the Sixteenth Century of the Existence of
a Rich and Splendid City in South America</i>, published in New York, clung to the idea;
and he represents the lake somewhat doubtingly as in 4° north, and between 60° and 63°
west, in the map accompanying his book.</p>

<p class="p2">Later in the seventeenth century the marvellous story took on another guise. It was
remembered that after the conquest of Peru a great emigration of Inca Indians had taken
place easterly beyond the mountains, and in the distant forests it was reputed they had
established a new empire; and the names of Paytiti and Enim, already mentioned, were
attached to these new theatres of Inca magnificence. Stories of this fabulous kingdom
continued to be hatched well on into the eighteenth century, and not a few expeditions of
more or less imposing strength were sent to find this kingdom. It never has been found;
but, as Mr. Markham thinks, there is some reason to believe that the Inca Indians who fled
with Tapac Amaru into the forests may for a considerable period have kept up their civilization
somewhere in those vast plains east of the Andes. The same writer says that the belief
was not without supporters when he was in Peru in 1853; and he adds that it is a pleasant
reflection that this story may possibly be true.<a name="FNanchor_1587_1587" id="FNanchor_1587_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a></p>

<p>The most considerable attempt of the seventeenth century to make better known the
course of the Amazon was the expedition under Texeira, sent in 1639 to see if a practicable
way could be found to transport the treasure from Peru by the Amazon to the Atlantic coast.
Acuña’s book on this expedition, <i>Nuevo descubrimiento del gran Rio de las Amazons</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1588_1588" id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>
published at Madrid in 1641, is translated in Markham’s <i>Valley of the Amazons</i>, published by
the Hakluyt Society. It was not till 1707, when Samuel Fritz, a Bohemian and a missionary,
published his map of the Amazons at Quito, that we find something better than the vaguest
delineation of the course of the great river.<a name="FNanchor_1589_1589" id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It is not the purpose of the present essay to continue the story of the explorations of
the Amazon into more recent times; but a word may be spared for the strange and sorrowful
adventures along its stream, which came in the train of the expedition that was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
out by the French Government in 1735 to measure an arc of the meridian in Peru, for comparing
the result with a similar measurement in Lapland. The object was to prove or
to disprove the theory of Sir Isaac Newton that the earth was flattened at the poles. The
commissioners&mdash;Bouguer, La Condamine, and Godin (the last accompanied by his wife)&mdash;arrived
at Quito in June, 1736. The arc was measured; but the task did not permit
them to think of returning before 1743, when La Condamine resolved to return by descending
the Amazon and then making his way to the French colony of Cayenne. He and his
companion, a Spanish gentleman seeking some adventure, had their full content of it,
but safely accomplished the journey.</p>

<p>Another of the commissioners, Godin, having tarried a few years longer in Peru, had
finally proceeded to Cayenne, where he made arrangements for embarking for France.
Through the favor of the Portuguese Government he had been provided with a galiot of
sixteen to twenty oars on a side, to ascend the river and meet his wife, who on receiving a
message from him was to leave Peru with an escort and come down the river and meet
him. Illness finally prevented the husband from proceeding; but he despatched the vessel,
having on board one Tristan, who was charged with a letter to send ahead. By some faithlessness
in Tristan, the letter miscarried; but Madame Godin sent a trusty messenger
in anticipation, who found the galiot at Loreto awaiting her arrival, and returned with the
tidings. The lady now started with her father and two brothers; and they allowed a certain
Frenchman who called himself a physician to accompany them, while her negro
servant, who had just returned over the route, attended them, as well as three Indian
women and thirty Indian men to carry burdens. They encountered the small-pox among
the river Indians, when their native porters deserted them. They found two other natives,
who assisted them in building a boat; but after two days upon it these Indians also deserted
them. They found another native, but he was shortly drowned. Then their boat
began to leak and was abandoned. On pretext of sending assistance back, the French
physician, taking with him the negro, pushed on to a settlement; but he forgot his
promise, and the faithful black was so impeded in attempting alone the task of rescue,
that he arrived at the camp only to find unrecognizable corpses. All but the lady had
succumbed. She pushed on alone through the wilderness, encountering perils that appall
as we read; but in the end, falling in with two Indians, she passed on from one mission
station to another, and reached the galiot.</p>

<p>Thus a hundred years later than Orellana, the great river still flowed with a story of
fearful hazards and treachery.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pc1 large">MAGELLAN’S DISCOVERY.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY REV. EDWARD E. HALE, D.D.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">FERNANDO DA MAGALHAENS, or Magalhâes, whom the French
and English call Magellan, was a Portuguese gentleman of good
family. He was educated, as well as his time knew how to educate men,
for the business which he followed through his life,&mdash;that of a navigator
and a discoverer. He was a child when Columbus first came home successful
from the West Indies; and as a boy and young man he grew up, in the
Court of King John the Second of Portugal, among people all alive to the
exciting novelties of new adventure. As early as 1505 he went to the East
Indies, where he served the Portuguese Government several years. He
was in the expedition which first discovered the Spice Islands of Banda,
Amboyna, Ternate, and Tidor. Well acquainted with the geography of
the East as far as the Portuguese adventurers had gone, he returned to
Portugal.</p>

<p>King Emmanuel was then upon the throne. Spain owes it to an unjust
slight which Magellan received at the Portuguese Court, that, under her
banner, this greatest of seamen sailed round the world and solved the
problem of ages in reaching the east by way of the west. Magellan was
in the service of the King in Morocco in a war which the Portuguese had
on hand there. He received a slight wound in his knee, which made him
lame for the rest of his life. Returning to Portugal, on some occasion
when he was pressing a claim for an allowance customary to men of his
rank, he was refused, and charged with pretending to an injury which was
really cured. Enraged at this insult, he abandoned his country. He did
this in the lordly style which seems in keeping with a Portuguese grandee
of his time. He published a formal act of renunciation of Portugal. He
went to Spain and took letters of naturalization there. In the most formal
way he announced that he was a subject of the King of Spain, and should
give service and life to that monarch, if he would use them.</p>

<p>Magellan had a companion in his exile; this was Ruy Faleiro, a gentleman
of Lisbon, who had also fallen into disgrace at Court. Faleiro,<a name="FNanchor_1590_1590" id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a> like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
Magellan, was a thorough geographer; and the two had persuaded themselves
that the shortest route to the Spice Islands of the East was to be
found in crossing the Western Ocean. We know now, that in this conviction
they were wrong. Any ordinary map of the eastern hemisphere
includes the Spice Islands or Moluccas, as well as Portugal, because the
distance in longitude east from Lisbon is less than that of the longitude
measured west. It has been proved, also, that the continent of America
extends farther south than that of Africa. This, Magellan and Faleiro did
not know; but they were willing to take the risk of it. Spain has always
held the Philippines,&mdash;the prize which she won as the reward of Magellan’s
great discovery,&mdash;under the treaty
of 1494, which gave to her half the
world beyond the meridian of three
hundred and seventy leagues west
from Ferro. She has held it because
Magellan sailed west, and so
struck the Philippines; but, in fact,
those islands lie within the half of
the world which the same treaty gave to Portugal.</p>

<p>By mistake or by design, the Philippines, when they were discovered,
were moved on the maps twenty-five degrees east of their true position
on the globe. The Spaniards made the maps. The islands were thus
brought within their half of the world; and this immense error was not
corrected till the voyages of Dampier.<a name="FNanchor_1591_1591" id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a></p>

<p>Charles V. was no fool. He recognized at once the value of such
men as Magellan and Faleiro. He heard and accepted their plan for a
western voyage to the spice regions. On the 22d of March, 1518, he bound
himself to fit out an expedition at his own cost on their plans, under Magellan’s
orders, on condition that the principal part of the profits should
belong to the Throne. Through years of intrigue, public and private, in
which the Spanish jealousy of Sevillian merchants and others tried to
break up the expedition, Charles was, for once, faithful to a promise.
We must not attempt here to follow the sad history of such intrigues.
On the 10th of August, 1519, the expedition sailed under Magellan.
Poor Faleiro, alas! had gone crazy in the mean time. What proved
even a greater misfortune was that Juan of Carthagena was put on board
the “San Antonio” as a sort of Japanese spy on Magellan. He was
the marplot of the expedition, as the history will show. He was called
a <i>veedor</i>, or inspector.</p>

<p>There is something pathetic in contrasting the magnificent fleet with
which Magellan sailed, under the patronage of an emperor, with the poor
little expedition of Columbus. With the new wealth of the Indies at command,
and with the resources now of a generation of successful discovery,
the Emperor directed the dockyards of Seville to meet all Magellan’s
wishes in the most thorough way. No man in the world, perhaps, knew
better than Magellan what he needed. The expedition, therefore, sailed
with as perfect a material equipment as the time knew how to furnish. It
consisted of five ships,&mdash;the “Trinidad” and “San Antonio,” each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
120 Spanish <i>toneles</i>, the “Concepcion,” of 90, the “Victoria,” of 85,&mdash;long
famous as the one vessel which made the whole voyage,&mdash;and the “Santiago,”
of 75. For the convenience of the translators this Spanish word <i>toneles</i>
is generally rendered by the French word <i>tonneaux</i> and the English word
<i>tons</i>. But in point of fact the <i>tonele</i> of Seville was one fifth larger than the
<i>tonelada</i> of the north of Spain, which nearly corresponds to our ton; and
the vessels of Magellan and Columbus were, in fact, so much larger than the
size which is generally assigned to them in the popular histories.<a name="FNanchor_1592_1592" id="FNanchor_1592_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a></p>

<p>On the 20th of September the fleet had cleared the River Guadalquivir,
and was fairly at sea. Six days afterward it touched at Teneriffe for supplies;
and here was the first quarrel between Magellan and his watchman,
Juan de Carthagena. Up to this point entire secrecy had been maintained
by Magellan as to the route to be pursued. Juan de Carthagena claimed
the right to be informed of all things regarding it. Magellan refused,
probably with considerable scorn. When off Sierra Leone, a few days
after, a similar quarrel broke out; Magellan arrested Carthagena with his
own hand, and put him in the stocks. Of course this was an insult the
most keen, and was meant to be. The other captains begged Magellan to
release the prisoner, and he did so; but still he kept him under the arrest
of one of their number.</p>

<p>From Sierra Leone they ran across to Brazil and anchored again for supplies
in the magnificent Bay of Rio de Janeiro. By their narrative, indeed,
on the return of the first vessel, was this great estuary made widely known
to the world. It is now known that Magellan was not the first discoverer.
Pero Lopez had explored the bay five years before; and as early as 1511 a
trader named John of Braga, probably a Portuguese, was established on one
of its fertile islands. Indeed, it is said that the hardy seamen of Dieppe
had been there as early as the beginning of the century. Its first name
was the Bay of Cabo-Frio.</p>

<p>The meridian of Alexander’s Bull had been meant to leave all the
American discoveries in the possession of the King of Spain. But, unfortunately
for him, Brazil runs so far out to the east that a meridian three
hundred and seventy leagues west of the Azores gives Portugal a considerable
part of it; and in point of fact the western boundary of Brazil has been
accommodated quite nearly to the imaginary line of the Pope. To
Magellan and his company it made no difference whether they were on
Portuguese or Spanish soil. They found the Brazilians friendly. “Though
they are not Christians, they are not idolaters, for they adore nothing.
Natural instinct is their only law.”</p>

<p>This is the phrase of Pigafetta, the young Italian gentleman to whose
<i>naïve</i> book we owe our best and fullest account of the great voyage. It is
clear enough that all the crews enjoyed their stay in the Bay of Santa Lucia,
by which name they called our Bay of Rio de Janeiro. It was in the heart
of the Brazilian summer, for they arrived on the 13th of December. They
had been nearly three months at sea, and were well disposed to enjoy tropical
luxuries; and here they stayed thirteen days. Pigafetta describes the
Brazilian hammocks;<a name="FNanchor_1593_1593" id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a> and from his description Europe has taken that
word. The same may perhaps be said of the mysterious word “canoe,”
which appears in his narrative under the spelling “canots.”<a name="FNanchor_1594_1594" id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Pigafetta’s first taste of the luxuries of the South American fields
and forests, and he delighted in their cheapness and variety. “For a king
of clubs I bought six chickens,” he writes; “and yet the Brazilian thought
he had made the best bargain,”&mdash;as, indeed, in the condition of the fine
arts at Santa Lucia,
he had. A knife or a
hook, however, bought
no more; yet the natives
had no tools of
metal. Their large
canoes, which would
carry thirty or forty
people, were painfully
dug out by knives of
stone from the great
trees of which they
were made. The Spaniards
ate the pineapple
for the first time.
Pigafetta does not
seem to have known
the sugar-cane before;
and he describes the
sweet potato as a novelty.
“It has almost the form of our turnip, and its taste resembles that
of chestnuts.” Here, also, he gives the name “patata,” which has clung
to this root, and has been transferred to the white potato also. For a
ribbon, or a hawk’s bell, the natives sold a “basketful.” Their successors
would doubtless do the same now.</p>

<p>The Spaniards found the Brazilians perfectly willing to trade. They
went wholly naked,&mdash;men and women. Their houses were long cabins.<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a>
The people told stories, which the navigators believed, of the very great
age of their old men, extending it even to one hundred and forty years.
They owned that they were cannibals on occasion; but they seem to have
eaten human flesh only as a symbol of triumph over conquered enemies.
They painted their bodies, and wore their hair short. Pigafetta says it was
woolly; but this must have been a mistake. Although he says they go
naked, he describes a sort of vest made of paroquet’s feathers. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>

<p>After a pleasant
stay of thirteen days
in this bay, Magellan
took the squadron to
the embouchure of
the River La Plata,
which had been discovered
four years
before by Juan Diaz
de Solis, who lost his
life there. The Spaniards
believed the
tribe of the Quérandis,
before whose
terrible <i>bolas</i> he had
fallen, to be cannibals;
and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
probably right in this supposition. Continuing the voyage southward,
Magellan’s fleet observed the two islands now marked as the “Penguins”
and “Lions.” The historian of the voyage notes the penguins and “sea-wolves”
which were then observed there. Passing these islands, they
opened a harbor, since known as Port Desire, where they spent the Southern
winter. It is near the latitude of 50° south. Magellan supposed it to
be in 49° 18´. Hardly had they arrived in this harbor, in itself sufficiently
inhospitable, when the mutiny broke out which had been brewing, probably,
since Magellan’s first insult to John of Carthagena. The announcement
made by Magellan that they were to winter here gave the signal for
the revolt. On Palm Sunday, which fell on the 1st of April that year, he
invited the captains and pilots to meet on his vessel to attend Mass and to
dine with him. Two of the captains, Mesquita and De Coca, accepted the
invitation and came with their staffs. Mendoza and Quesada did not come.
Juan de Carthagena, it will be remembered, was under arrest, and he, of
course, was not invited. The same night Quesada, with De Carthagena
and thirty men, crossed from the “Concepçion” to the “San Antonio,”
and made an effort to take Mesquita prisoner. At first they succeeded;
but the ship’s master, Eliorraga, defended him and his so bravely that, with
succor from Magellan, he retained the command. The purpose of the
conspirators seems to have been simply to return to Spain without wintering
in so bleak a home. The three rebels sent to Magellan to say that they
would recognize him as their commander, but they were sure that the King
did not propose such an undertaking as this to which he was committing
them. Of course, under the guise of respect, this was to exact submission
from him. Magellan bade them come on board the flagship. They refused.
Magellan kept the boat which they then sent him, and despatched
six men, under Espinosa, to the “Victoria” to summon Mendoza. Mendoza
answered with a sneer. Espinosa at once stabbed him in the neck,
and a sailor struck him down with a cutlass. Magellan then sent another
boat, with fifteen men, who took possession of the “Victoria.” In every
case the crews seem to have taken his side against their own captains.
The next day, the 3d of April, he obtained full possession of the “Santiago”
and “Concepçion.”</p>

<p>On the 4th of that month he quartered the body of Mendoza and published
his sentence as a traitor. On the 7th he beheaded Quesada, whose
own servant, Molino, volunteered as executioner. When Drake arrived
here, fifty-eight years after, he supposed he found the bones of Mendoza
or Quesada under a gibbet which was still standing. Juan de Carthagena
and the priest Pedro Sanchez de la Reina were convicted as partners
in the mutiny, and sentenced to remain when the ships sailed.
This sentence was afterwards executed. Magellan doubtless felt that
these examples were sufficient, and he pardoned forty of the crew; but,
as the reader will see, the spirit which prompted the mutiny was not
yet extinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span></p>

<p>They had lived here two months without seeing any of the natives, when
one day, according to the narrative of Pigafetta, a giant appeared to them
when they least expected to see any one. “He was singing and dancing
on the sand, and throwing dust upon his head, almost naked. The captain
sent one of our sailors on shore, with orders to make the same gestures as
tokens of peace. This the man did; he was understood, and the giant
permitted himself to be led to a little island where the captain had landed.
I was there also, with many others. The giant expressed much astonishment
at seeing us. He pointed to heaven, and undoubtedly meant to say
that he thought we descended from heaven.</p>

<p>“This man,” continues Pigafetta, “was so tall that our heads hardly came
up to his belt. He was well formed; his face was broad and colored with
red, excepting that his eyes were surrounded with yellow, and he had two
heart-shaped spots upon his cheeks. He had but little hair, and this was
whitened with a sort of powder. His dress, or rather cloak, was made of
furs well sewed,&mdash;taken from an animal well known in this region, as we
afterwards found. He also wore shoes of the same skin.”</p>

<p>It seems desirable to copy this description in detail, because here begins
in literature the vexed question as to the existence of giants in Patagonia.
Whether there ever were any there is now doubted, though the name
“Patagonian” is the synonyme of giant in every European language. While
the narrative of Pigafetta is thus distinct in saying that one giant only
appeared at first, another authority, with equal definiteness, says that six
men appeared; and it afterwards appears that two of these, at least, were
larger than the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The comparison of the details of this last narrative in Herrera with that
of Pigafetta illustrates curiously the perplexity of all historical inquiry;
for we are here distinctly told that there were six who appeared on the
shore and seemed willing to come on board. A boat was sent for them,
and they embarked on the flagship without fear. Once on deck, the
Spaniards offered them a kettle full of biscuit,&mdash;which was enough, as
they supposed, for twenty men; but, with the appetite of hungry Indians,
the six devoured it all immediately. They wore mantles of furs, and
carried bows and arrows. The bows were about half a fathom long; the
arrows were barbed with sharp stones. All were shod with large shoes,
like the giant.</p>

<p>On another day two Indians brought on board a tapir, and it proved
that their dresses were made from the fur of this animal. Magellan gave
them in exchange two red dresses, with which they were well satisfied. It
is not till the next day that Herrera places the visit of the giant. That
author says that the Indian expressed a wish to become a Christian, and
that the Spaniards gave him the name of John. Seeing the crew throwing
some mice overboard, he asked that they might be given to him to eat.
For six days he took all the mice the ship could furnish, and was never
afterward seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span></p>

<p>More than twenty days later, four Indians of the first party returned
to the ships, and Magellan gave orders that two of them should be seized
to carry home. The men were so large that the Spaniards could not make
them prisoners without treachery. Loading the poor giants with more
gifts than they could well carry, they finally asked each to accept an iron
chain, fitted with manacles. The two Indians were eager enough to accept
the fatal present, and were easily persuaded to have the chains fastened
to their legs, that they might the more easily carry them away. They found,
alas! as so many other men have found, that what they took for ornament
was a cruel snare; but, thus crippled, they were overpowered. Their
screams of rage were heard by their companions on shore. It was
after this treachery that the natives first attacked the Spaniards. Seeing
fires at night, Magellan landed a party for exploration. Seven Spaniards
found the tracks of Indians and followed them ineffectually. As they
returned, however, nine Indians followed, attacked them, and killed one
Castilian. But for their shields, all the Spaniards would have been killed.
The Spaniards closed upon them with their knives, and put them to flight,
visited their camp, and feasted from the store of meat they found there.
The next day Magellan sent a larger party on shore and buried the dead
Castilian.</p>

<p>The reader is now in possession of all the statements from which we are
to decide the much-disputed question whether, in the time of Magellan,
Patagonia was a land of giants. He is to remember that Pigafetta, who was
the friend and fellow-voyager of the giant Paul, one of the two captives,
does not in other instances go out of his way to invent the marvellous,
though he often does repeat marvellous stories which have been related by
others. It is to be observed that none of the voyagers pretend to have seen
any large number of Patagonians. The largest number seen at one time
was nine; and even if these were different from the six who came to the
ship, fifteen is the largest number of the native visitors to the squadron.
Of these, according to one account, in which three at least of the authorities
agree, two are of extraordinary height, so that the heads of the Spaniards
reached only to their girdles. It is also said that the feet or shoes of all
were large, “but not disproportionate to their stature.” For three hundred
years, on this testimony, it was perhaps generally believed that the Patagonians
were very large men. The statement was positively made that they
were nine feet high. But as other voyagers, especially in this century, more
and more often brought home accounts in which no such giants appeared,
there was an increasing distrust of the original Spanish narrative.</p>

<p>Especially when navigators had to do with the wretched Kemenettes
and Karaikes of the Straits, who are a tribe of really insignificant stature,
was indignation liberally bestowed on the old traveller’s story; and when,
in 1837, the original narrative of the Genoese pilot was brought to light by
Navarrete,&mdash;a simple and unexaggerated story; when it proved that he
made no allusion whatever to any persons of remarkable height,&mdash;the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
giant story was declared to be an invention of Pigafetta, and the gigantic
size of the Patagonians was denounced as a mere traveller’s fable. Such
criticism probably goes too far.</p>

<p>The simple facts may be taken, and the hasty inference may be disregarded.
Every travelling showman will testify to the fact that there
occasionally appear men, even under the restrictions of civilization, who are
so tall that the Spaniards, not of a large race, would only come to their
girdles.<a name="FNanchor_1599_1599" id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a> If Pigafetta is to be believed, two such men came to Magellan’s
squadron. Tall men
came to Cook’s squadron
at Honolulu, a hundred
years ago, who
were quite above the
average of his men.</p>

<p>Magellan supposed
that these were typical
men, that they were
specimens of their race.
Because he supposed so
he captured them and
tried to carry them to
Spain. Magellan was
mistaken. They were
not specimens of their
race; they were extraordinary
exceptions
to it. But the ready
tribe of geographers,
eager to accept marvels
from the New World,
at once formed the conclusion that because these two were so large, all
Patagonians would prove to be so.</p>

<p>Pigafetta drew no such inference, nor is there any evidence that the
Spaniards ever did. On the other hand, six Spaniards, with their knives,
closed fearlessly on nine of these men, and routed them in a hand-to-hand
fight. We may fairly conclude that the delusion which modern criticism
has dispelled was not intentionally called into being by the navigators, but
was rather the deduction drawn from too narrow premises by credulous
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1600_1600" id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span></p>

<p>The next voyagers who saw these people were Drake’s party. Fletcher,
writing in the <i>World Encompassed</i>, after fifty-eight years, says distinctly
in his narrative of Drake’s arrival at this same Port Julian: “We had no
sooner landed than <i>two young giants</i> repaired to them.” Again, speaking
of the same interview, “he was visited by two of the inhabitants, whom
Magellan named Patagous, or rather Pentagours, from their huge stature.”
And afterward he resumes the matter in these words: “Magellane was not
altogether deceived in naming them giants, for they generally differ from
the common sort of men
both in stature, bigness, and
strength of body, as also
in the hideousness of their
voice. But yet they are
nothing so monstrous or
giant-like as they are reported,
there being some
Englishmen as tall as the
highest of any we could
see. But peradventure the
Spaniards did not think
that ever any Englishman
would come thither to reprove
them, and thereupon
might presume the more
boldly to lie,&mdash;the name
Pentagones, five cubits, viz.
seven foot and half, describing
the full height (if
not somewhat more) of the
highest of them.”</p>

observed him upon the River of Janaira.
He had a great body, proportionably gross,
exceeding strong. His portraiture I brought
from that country, with two green stones in his
cheeks and one on his chin.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>This last sneer is in
Fletcher’s worst vein. The
etymology of “Pentagones” is all his own. Magellan’s people say distinctly
that they named the Patagonians from their large feet,&mdash;taking the
phrase “large feet” from the large shoes which they wore to protect their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
feet from cold. The language is distinct: “Their shoes go four inches
above the great toe, and the space is filled with straw to keep them from
the cold.” These shoes, of this same form, are figured by modern artists,
who have drawn for us the Tehuelches of to-day. It is quite possible
that the false etymology which made “Patagonian” mean “Five-cubit
man” was the real foundation for the general notion of the gigantic size
of the race.</p>

<p>From these winter quarters Magellan despatched the “Sant Iago” to
examine the coast. The vessel was unfortunately lost on the rocks, but all
the crew were saved. Two sailors returned to the rest of the squadron
with news of the disaster, and the commander sent back supplies. They
were near a hundred miles away from him, but he kept them supplied
with provisions; and they were able to rescue a part of the stores and
equipage of their vessel. At the end of two months, in which they
encamped upon the shore, they rejoined him. It is observed that with
them the winter was so cold that for water for their daily use they were
obliged to melt ice.</p>

<p>After taking possession of Patagonia in the name of the King of Spain,
by planting a standard on a hill which they called Monte Cristo, Magellan
sailed on the 24th of August from this inhospitable bay. He now carried
out the cruel sentence of the Court on Juan de Carthagena and the priest
Pedro Sanches. He landed them with a supply of biscuit and wine, and
left them to their fate.</p>

<p>Two days after, following the coast, he entered the River of Santa Cruz
and narrowly escaped shipwreck there. He was able to supply himself
with wood, water, and fish. On the 11th of October he observed an eclipse
of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_1601_1601" id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a></p>

<p>Still keeping on, during the 21st of October, the day which the Church
consecrated to the “Eleven thousand Virgins,” they discovered a strait, to
which Magellan gave that name. It was the entry to the famous channel,
four hundred and forty miles long, according to his estimate, which has
for so many years borne his name. The depth of water near the shore,
which has since been observed, attracted the attention of the Spaniards.
The mountains which looked down upon it were high, and covered
with snow.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The crew and the captains, even after the hard experience of the
mutineers, did not hesitate to express their unwillingness to enter the blind
and narrow channel before them. Magellan summoned the commanders
and made to them a formal declaration, of which the substance has been
preserved. He told them that their sovereign and his had sent them for
this very purpose, to discover this strait and to pass through it. If they
were faithless as to its issue, he declared that he had seen in the archives
of the King of Portugal a map, drawn by Martin Behaim, in which the strait
was indicated, and that it opened into the western ocean. The squadron
should not turn back, he said; and he gave his order for the continuation
of the voyage in this determination. If the vessels separated, the commander
of each was to keep on until he had reached the latitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
75° S. If then the strait had not been found, any commander might
turn eastward; yet he was not to seek Spain, but to sail to the Moluccas,
which were the objective of the voyage; and the proper sailing
directions were given for reaching those islands by the route through the
Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The geographers have been at a loss to reconcile this statement,&mdash;that
Martin Behaim had already drawn the strait upon a map or globe,&mdash;with
Magellan’s claim to be its discoverer. But, as the reader knows, there
was no lack of straits or of continents on the various maps before Magellan’s
time which could be cited for any theory of any cosmographer. We know
the history of navigation well enough to understand that, whatever drawings
Magellan might have seen or cited, nothing can shake his reputation as the
far-sighted discoverer of the channel to which, without any hesitation, the
world has given his name.<a name="FNanchor_1602_1602" id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a></p>

<p>His firmness had so much effect that the captains went back to their
ships, pretending to accede to his wishes. With the “Trinidad” and “Victoria,”
Magellan waited at the entrance of the channel while he despatched
the “San Antonio” and “Concepçion” to complete the survey of it westward.
Hardly had the squadron divided, when a terrible tempest broke
upon both parts of it, lasting thirty-six hours. Magellan’s ships lost
their anchors, and were at the mercy of the wind in the open bay. The
other vessels seem to have run before the gale. At the moment when their
people thought themselves lost, they opened the first “reach”&mdash;if it may so
be called&mdash;of the strait; they pushed through it till they came to the bay
now known as “Bouçault Bay.” Crossing this, with increasing confidence,
they came into the second channel, which opens into a second bay larger than
the first. After this success they returned to report their progress to their
commander.</p>

<p>He and his officers, meanwhile, had begun to fear that their companions
had been lost in the tempest. A column of smoke on shore was supposed
to be a signal of the spot where they had taken refuge. But in the midst of
such uncertainty their vessels reappeared, and soon fired shots from their
guns in token of joy. They were as joyfully welcomed; and, as soon as they
could tell their news, the reunited squadron gladly proceeded through the
two channels which they had opened. When they arrived in the bay which
had been the farthest discovery of the pioneer vessels, they found two
channels opening from it. At the southeast is that marked “Supposé” on
Bougainville’s map; and to this channel Magellan directed Mesquita in the
“San Antonio,” and Juan Serrano in the “Concepçion.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the sailing-master of the “San Antonio” was Stephen
Gomez, who hated Magellan with a long-cherished hatred. When Magellan
first arrived in Spain, Gomez was, or thought he was, on the eve of
starting on an expedition of discovery under the patronage of the Crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
Magellan’s grand plan had broken up this lesser expedition; and instead of
commanding it, Gomez had found himself placed in a subordinate post
under his rival’s command. He now took his chance to revenge himself
as soon as he was directed to survey the new channel. Before night fell
he had escaped from the surveillance of the “Concepçion.” At night he
caballed with the Spaniards of his own crew; they rose upon their captain
Mesquita, a Portuguese, the loyal cousin of Magellan, and put him in irons.
Without delay they then escaped from the squadron; and returning, through
the channels they had traced, to the Atlantic, they sailed for home. Touching
at the forlorn harbor where they had wintered, they picked up the two
mutineers who had been left there. Indeed, it is fair to suppose that their
whole plot dated back for its origin to the unsuccessful enterprise of the
winter.<a name="FNanchor_1603_1603" id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a></p>

<p>Magellan, on his part, waited for the “San Antonio,” which had been
directed to return in three days. Though the channel which she was to
explore passed between mountains covered with snow, we are told that the
strait where Magellan awaited them lay between regions which were “the
most beautiful in the world.” On the southern side they had, once and
again, observed fires in the night, and they gave to that land the name of
“Tierra del Fuego,” “the Land of Fire,” which it has ever since preserved.
They did not see any of the natives on either coast. The sailors caught so
many fish which resembled the sardines of their home, that the name of
“River of Sardines” was given to a stream which makes its outlet there.
Finding that the “San Antonio” had left him, and probably suspecting her
treachery, Magellan went forward through the southwestern channel with
the “Victoria” and the “Trinidad.”</p>

<p>It is at this point that we are to place a formal correspondence which
has been preserved by a Portuguese historian<a name="FNanchor_1604_1604" id="FNanchor_1604_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> as passing between Magellan
and one of his captains on the question of advancing. These letters are
dated the 22d of November, 1520. Martin Mendoza, in his reply to Magellan’s
letter, agrees that until the 1st of January they should persevere
while the days are long, but urges that the vessels should lie by in the
darkness. He is as resolute in expressing the conviction that they should
be out of the strait before the month of January is over,&mdash;that is, that
they should turn about, if necessary, on January 1, if they had not then
reached the Pacific, so as to be well in the Atlantic again by the first of
February; that then they should give up the original object of the voyage
and sail to Cadiz. The document seems genuine; but, as the reader will
see, there was no occasion for using its counsels. Before the 1st of January
they were free of the strait forever.</p>

<p>While his squadron loitered in hope of the “San Antonio’s” return,
Magellan sent forward a boat to explore the channel. On the third day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
she returned to him with the joyful news that they had opened the western
mouth of the strait.</p>

<p>The Pacific was found! The chroniclers say that the crews wept for
joy; and they may well have done so. They gave to the Cape&mdash;which
made the western end of Tierra del Fuego, on this channel&mdash;the name of
the “Desired Cape,” “Cabo Deseado,” which it still retains.</p>

<p>The squadron did not at once follow. Magellan put back for the other
vessels, and met the “Concepçion” alone. He sent back the “Victoria”
this time to search for his faithless consort. If she were not found, his
orders were that a standard should be planted on high ground, at the foot
of which should be buried a letter, with an account of the destination of
the squadron. Two similar signals were left,&mdash;one on the shore of the first
bay, and one on the Isle of Lions, in the channel. But the “Victoria,” as
the reader knows, did not find the “San Antonio;” she was far away.
And with three vessels of his squadron only, Magellan passed out from the
strait which had detained him so long, into the ocean. They fairly entered
upon it on the 28th of November.</p>

<p>Pigafetta, in his joy at leaving this strait, which had been the scene of
so much anxiety, describes its natural advantages in glowing colors. “In
fine, I do not believe there is a better strait than this in the world,” he says.
They gave to it the name of “Strait of the Patagonians;” but the world has
long since known it by the name of its discoverer. “There may be found
at any half-league a good harbor,”&mdash;such is the Italian historian’s statement,&mdash;“with
excellent water, cedar-wood, sardine-fish, and an abundance
of shellfish. There are also herbs on shore, some of which are bitter, but
others are good to eat,&mdash;especially a sort of celery,<a name="FNanchor_1605_1605" id="FNanchor_1605_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a> which grows near
the springs, of which we made excellent food.” Cook found celery of the
same kind two centuries and a half later, as well as abundance of <i>Cochlearia</i>.
So great are the advantages of such supplies for the health of
crews in danger of scurvy, that he thought the passage into the Pacific
by the Straits of Magellan preferable to that by Cape Horn.<a name="FNanchor_1606_1606" id="FNanchor_1606_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a> In later
days his advice has always been followed by vessels having the aid of
steam.</p>

<p>Thus ended the only glimpse which Spaniards had of Patagonia for
many years. Magellan’s act of possession held, however; for the country
has no attractions to make it a stake for wars or other controversy. Magellan
looked his last upon it as his squadron gladly steered northward; and
after leaving his Cape Victory,&mdash;for he gave that name to the southwestern
point of America,&mdash;neither he nor his landed again on this continent.</p>

<p>The poor giants who had been so cruelly enslaved never reached Spain.
One was on the “San Antonio” with Serrano, who deserted his commander
in the strait. This one died before they had crossed the Atlantic. The
other was on board the “Trinidad,” the flagship, with Magellan and Pigafetta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
the historian of the expedition. He became fond of Pigafetta; and
when he saw him produce his writing tablet and paper, he knew what was
expected of him, and of his own accord began to give the names of different
objects in the Patagonian language.<a name="FNanchor_1607_1607" id="FNanchor_1607_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> One day when he saw Pigafetta
kiss the cross, he told him by signs that <i>Setebos</i> would enter him and make
him a coward. But when he was himself dying&mdash;of scurvy, most likely,
which was decimating the crew&mdash;he asked for the cross himself, kissed it,
and begged to be baptized. His captors baptized him, gave him the name
of Paul, and he died.</p>

<p>It would have been natural for Magellan, now that he had attained the
South Sea, to sail by a direct route to the Moluccas, of which he was in
search. Till a very late period the geographers have supposed that he
did; and his track will be found on most of the large globes, to a period
comparatively recent, laid down on a course a little west of northwest,&mdash;as,
indeed, Pigafetta says they ran.</p>

<p>It was not observed by these globe-makers, and in fact to many of them
it was not known, that, if Magellan had taken such a course, he would have
run directly into the teeth of those northwest winds which blow with great
regularity in that part of the Pacific, and he would have met a steady current
in the same direction. In such computations, also, it was forgotten
that Magellan supposed the Pacific to be much narrower than it is, and
that when he left the straits he did not anticipate so long a voyage as he
had. But the fortunate discovery of the log-book of one of the “pilots”
now gives us the declination of the sun and the computed latitude for every
day of the Pacific voyage. It appears that Magellan held well to the north,
not far from the coast of South America, till he had passed, on the west,
the islands of Juan Fernandez and Masafuera without seeing them, and
only then struck to the northwest, and afterwards to the west.<a name="FNanchor_1608_1608" id="FNanchor_1608_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a> He thus
came out at the equator at a point which, by their mistaken computation of
longitude, was 152° W. of the meridian of Ferro, 159° 46’ west of our first
meridian of Greenwich.</p>

<p>The Pacific is now known to us as an ocean studded with islands, the
inhabitants of which are well provided with food from their own land, and
water.<a name="FNanchor_1609_1609" id="FNanchor_1609_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, however, the remarkable fortune of Magellan in this voyage
to sail more than ten thousand miles and see but two of these islands,
both of which were barren and uninhabited. He found no bottom close to
the shore. At the second of the two islands he stopped to fish for sharks,
and gave it the name “Shark’s Island,” or “Tiburones.” The crew were
so impressed by their dismal welcome that they called the two “Desventuradas,”
the “Unfortunate Islands.” These two islands, the first-born to
Europe of the multitudes of the Pacific Ocean, cannot now be identified.<a name="FNanchor_1610_1610" id="FNanchor_1610_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a></p>

         <p class="pf400">[This fac-simile is made from the Paris edition
of Amoretti’s <i>Pigafetta</i>, p. 62, and shows
the catamaran of the natives.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the 6th of March the voyagers at last saw two more small islands.
Soon a number of small sails appeared, the islanders coming out to meet
the ships. Their little boats had large triangular-shaped sails of matting,
and they seemed to fly over the water. The Spanish seamen saw for the
first time the curious catamarans of the natives of these waters.</p>

<p>Magellan was tempted to land at a third and larger island. This was
either the one since known as Guahan, or that known as Rota; Magellan
called it Ivagana. So many of the natives swarmed upon his ship, and they
were so rapacious in stealing whatever they could lay their hands on, that
he found himself almost at their mercy. They begged him to land, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
stole the boat attached to the stern of his ship. At last Magellan did land,
in a rage. He burned some of their huts, several of their boats, got back
his own, and killed seven men.</p>

<p>The squadron, after this encounter, continued its westward course, followed
by a hundred canoes. The savages now showed fish, as if they wished
to trade; but the women wept and tore their hair, probably “because we
had killed their husbands.”</p>

<p>To this group the Spaniards gave the name of “Ladrones, the robbers,”
which it has ever since retained. After three hundred leagues more of
westward sailing, the tired navigators, half starved and dying of scurvy,
made the discovery of Zamal, now called Samar, the first of the group since
known as the Philippines,&mdash;a name they took from Philip the Second.
Magellan called them the Archipelago of St. Lazarus, because he first found
how large a group it was on St. Lazarus’ day, the fifth Sunday in Lent.</p>

<p>In these islands the navigators were, at first, most cordially received.
By means of a Malayan interpreter they were able to communicate with
the natives. Before six weeks were over, with rapidity which may well
have seemed miraculous, they had converted the king and many of the
princes and people to what they deemed Christianity. But, alas! the six
weeks ended in the defeat of the Spanish men-at-arms in a battle with a
rival prince, in the death of Magellan and the murder of Serrano, who had
been chosen as one of those who should take his place. The surviving
Spaniards withdrew as well as they could from their exasperated allies.</p>

<p>They were obliged to destroy one of their ships, which was leaking, and
thus were left with only two. One of these, the “Trinidad,” they despatched
eastward to the American coast; but she failed in this voyage, and returned
to the Philippines. In the other vessel, the “Victoria,” Sebastian del Cano
and his crew, after spending the rest of that year in the East Indies, sailed
for Europe. They left the Island of Timor on the 11th of February.
Though they had nothing but rice and water for their supplies, they dared
not touch at the Portuguese establishment at Mozambique. After they
doubled the Cape of Good Hope, on the 6th of May, they lost twenty-one
men in two months. Their provisions had failed entirely when, on the 9th
of July, they touched at Santa Argo, in the Cape de Verde Islands.</p>

<p>Even now they did not dare tell the Portuguese at that island who they
were. They pretended they came from the coast of America. When they
found that the day was Thursday, they were greatly astonished, for by their
own journals it was Wednesday. Twice they sent their boat ashore for a
load of rice, and it returned. The third time they saw that it was seized.
One of the sailors had revealed their secret, and the jealous Portuguese
would no longer befriend them.</p>

<p>The poor “Victoria,” with such supplies as she had received, was obliged
to run direct for Spain. On the 6th of September she entered the bay of
San Lucar again. By their own computation they had sailed 14,460 leagues.
Of sixty men who sailed in her from the Moluccas there were but eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
survivors of these almost all were sick. Of the other forty-two, some
had deserted at Timor, some had been condemned to death for their crimes,
and the others had died. This was all that was returned of two hundred
and thirty-seven persons who had sailed three years before on this magnificent
expedition.</p>

<p>Del Cano was received at Court with the greatest courtesy. The Emperor
gave him a pension of five hundred ducats, and for armorial bearings
a globe with the device&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“<span class="smcap">Primus circumdedisti Me.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">The “Victoria” was richly stored with cloves and other spices. Of these
the sale was carefully managed, and the proceeds were enormous. The
foresight of Magellan was completely justified, and the profits of the expedition
alone immediately tempted the Emperor to fit out another. The
“Victoria” afterward made two voyages to the West Indies, but never returned
to Spain from the second, and her fate is not known. An ancient
representation of her (from Hulsius) is the distinguishing sign on the cover
of the volumes issued in our day by the Hakluyt Society.</p>

<h3><a name="c613" id="c613">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></h3>

<p class="pc1"><span class="smcap">By Edward E. Hale and the Editor.</span></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">PIGAFETTA, who was born in Vicenza not long after 1490, was accordingly from
twenty-five to thirty years old when he accompanied Magellan.<a name="FNanchor_1611_1611" id="FNanchor_1611_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a> He kept a diary
of the voyage, a copy of which he gave to the Emperor; and later, in Italy, he wrote out a
more extended account, copies of which he gave to distinguished persons. Of this ampler
narrative four separate texts, in as many manuscripts, are preserved to us.</p>

<p>No. 1 is in French, <i>Navigation et descouvrement de la Indie superieure faicte par moi
Antoine Pigafete, Vincentin</i>; on paper, in the National Library at Paris. It gives the full
vocabulary of the Giants’ language, which is also reprinted in Amoretti. Students engaged
in the study of the geography of the East Indies should not be satisfied with the
few copies given by Amoretti of the maps and representations of the islands there. In
this copy, which is divided throughout into short chapters, there are many more of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
maps than have been engraved. It is impossible to look at them without believing that
they give some idea of the size and even the shape of the islands visited. Charton calls
this paper manuscript the oldest of those in France. No one can decide such a question.
The illustrations in the vellum manuscript certainly seem to be nearer the originals than
those in this coarser paper one.</p>

<p>No. 2 is a richly illuminated vellum document, with a text somewhat softened in the
coarse parts. This may have been the copy known to have been given to Louise of Savoy
by Pigafetta. This manuscript is also in the Paris library. The writing is elegant, and the
maps are very prettily done in body color. They are much more elegant than the maps in
the paper manuscript, which are in rough water-color by some one of no great artistic skill.
The representations given by Amoretti of a few of the designs are sufficiently good for all
practical purposes. But the picture of the boat with outriggers, illustrating the customs of
the Ladrone Islands, is much more artistic in the vellum manuscript than it is in Amoretti’s
engraving.</p>

<p>No. 3, the most complete, was owned by M. Beaupré, at Nancy, in 1841, when Thomassy
described it; was sold in the Potier sale in 1851 (no. 506), and passed into the Solar
Collection, and in 1861 (Solar sale, no. 3,238) it was bought by a London dealer, and
reached finally the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps, who bought it at the Libri sale
(no. 1,139) in 1862. It is a question with critics whether Pigafetta composed his work
in French or in Italian; for there is also a manuscript (no. 4) in the later language, poorly
conceived, however, and mixed with Spanish, preserved in the Ambrosian Library at Milan.
This was the manuscript published by the Abbé C. Amoretti; it is written in the character
known as <i>cancelleresco</i>, on paper folios, of which the handwriting is of the time of
Pigafetta; and it was once owned by the Cardinal Frederic Borroméo. Raymond Thomassy<a name="FNanchor_1612_1612" id="FNanchor_1612_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a>
gives several reasons for believing that the French text is the original, but we
have not been satisfied that it was so.<a name="FNanchor_1613_1613" id="FNanchor_1613_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a></p>

<p>In the earliest edition of Pigafetta which we have,&mdash;one without date, and in French,
edited by Antoine Fabre,&mdash;the text is represented as being a translation from the Italian.
It is possible that, being an abridgment, it might have followed some abstract which had
been made in that language, possibly an account which in 1524 Pigafetta asked permission
to print,<a name="FNanchor_1614_1614" id="FNanchor_1614_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> of the Doge and Council of Venice. This original French edition is called
<i>Le Voyage et Navigation faict par les Espaignolz es isles de Mollucques</i>; and is usually
thought to have been printed in 1525. It is in Gothic type, except the last four leaves,
which are in Roman, as are all the notes.<a name="FNanchor_1615_1615" id="FNanchor_1615_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a> Harrisse cites<a name="FNanchor_1616_1616" id="FNanchor_1616_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> an Italian edition of Pigafetta
with the letter of Maximilian, as published at Venice in 1534;<a name="FNanchor_1617_1617" id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> but there is little reason
to believe such an edition to exist.</p>

<p>The earliest undoubted Italian edition was printed, however, in 1536, and it was professedly
a translation from Fabre’s French text, and there is reason to believe that Ramusio
may have been instrumental in its publication.<a name="FNanchor_1618_1618" id="FNanchor_1618_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a> It has the name neither of author nor of

<p>Amoretti published the Ambrosian manuscript (no. 4, above) in 1800, at Milan, under
the title of <i>Primo viaggio intorno al globo terracqueo ossia ragguaglio della navigazione
alle Indie orientali d[i] Magaglianes, 1519-1522</i>. <i>Pubblicato per la prima volta da un
codice manuscritto della Biblioteca Ambrosiana di Milano, e corredato di note da C.
Amoretti con un transunto del Trattato di navigazione dello stesso autore. Milano,
1800.</i><a name="FNanchor_1620_1620" id="FNanchor_1620_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a></p>

<p>About a month after the return of Del Cano in the “Victoria,” Maximilian Transylvanus
(a son-in-law of Cristóbal de Haro, who had been a chief advocate of the voyage
at the Spanish Court) wrote to the Cardinal Archbishop of Salzburg a brief account of
the voyage, in a letter dated at Valladolid, Oct. 24, 1522;<a name="FNanchor_1621_1621" id="FNanchor_1621_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a> and when it was printed at
Cologne in January, 1523, as <i>De Moluccis insulis</i>, and in the following November and again
in February, 1524, at Rome, as <i>De Hispanorum in orientem navigatione</i>, its text constituted
the earliest narrative of the voyage which was given in print.<a name="FNanchor_1622_1622" id="FNanchor_1622_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> It was afterward
printed in connection with the earliest Italian edition of Pigafetta; and the English reader
will find it in the volume on Magellan published by the Hakluyt Society.</p>

<p>Ramusio also tells us that Peter Martyr wrote an account of Magellan’s voyage, gathered
from the lips of the survivors, which he sent to Rome to be printed, but that in the sack
of that city by the Constable de Bourbon it disappeared. We have but one point of this
Martyr narrative preserved to us, and that is the loss of one day which the “Victory”
had experienced in her westering voyage,&mdash;when arriving in Seville on the 6th of September,
1522, as her crew supposed, they found the Sevillians calling it the 7th.<a name="FNanchor_1623_1623" id="FNanchor_1623_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a></p>

<p>There are two modern gatherings of the most important documentary illustrations of
this famous voyage,&mdash;the one made by Navarrete, and the other published by the Hakluyt
Society. The former constitutes the fourth volume of Navarrete’s well-known <i>Coleccion</i>;
and among the variety of its papers printed or cited largely from the public archives, illustrating
the fitting out of the fleet, its voyage, and the reception of Del Cano on his return,
a few of the more important may be mentioned. Such is a manuscript from the library of
San Isadro el Real de Madrid, purporting to be by Magellan himself; but Navarrete does
not admit this. He prints for the first time an original manuscript account in the Seville
archives, usually cited as the Seville manuscript, which bears the title of <i>Extracto de la
habilitacion</i>, etc. It gives an enumeration of the company which composed the force on
the fleet. The Navarrete volume also contains the log-book of Francisco Albo, or Alvaro,
printed, it is claimed by Stanley (who also includes it in the Hakluyt Society volume),
from a copy in the British Museum, which was made from the original at Simancas. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
follows the fortunes of the fleet after they sighted Cape St. Augustine. Muñoz had found
in the Archives of Torre de Tombo a letter of Antonio Brito to the King of Portugal, and
Navarrete gives this also.<a name="FNanchor_1624_1624" id="FNanchor_1624_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a> A letter of Jean Sebastian del Cano to Charles V., dated
Sept. 5, 1527, describes the voyage, and is also to be found here.<a name="FNanchor_1625_1625" id="FNanchor_1625_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a></p>

<p>The Hakluyt Society volume borrows largely from the lesser sources as given in
Navarrete, and among other papers it contains the brief narrative which is found in Ramusio
as that of an “anonymous Portuguese.” It also gives an English version of what is known
as the account of the Genoese pilot, one Joan Bautista probably. This story exists in
three Portuguese manuscripts: one belongs to the library of the monks of S. Bento da
Sande; another is in the National Library at Paris; and from these two a text was formed
which was printed in 1826 in the <i>Noticias Ultramarinhas</i> (vol. iv.) of the Lisbon Academy
of History, as “Roteiro da viagem de Fernam de Magalhâes” (1519). A third manuscript
is in the library of the Academy of History at Madrid. As edited by Luigi Hugues, it is
printed in the fifteenth volume of the <i>Atti della Società Ligure di Storia Patria</i>.</p>

<p>The narrative in the preceding text has shown that the precise statements of latitude
made by the Genoese pilot have wholly destroyed the value of all speculations as to the
route of Magellan from the Straits to the Ladrones which were published before this
“Roteiro” became known. The track laid down on the older globes is invariably wrong,
and Magellan’s course was in reality that along which the currents would easily have propelled
him, being that of the Antarctic stream of the Pacific, which Humboldt has explained.<a name="FNanchor_1626_1626" id="FNanchor_1626_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a>
Stanley also points out that the narrative given in Gaspar Correa’s <i>Lendas da
India</i> is the only authority we have for the warning given to Magellan at Teneriffe by
Barbosa; and for the incident of a Portuguese ship speaking the “Victoria” as the latter
was passing the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>One Pedro Mexia had seen the fleet of Magellan sail, and had likewise witnessed the
return of Del Cano. A collection of miscellanies, which he printed as early as 1526, under
the title of <i>Silva</i>, and which passed through many editions, affords another contemporary
reference.<a name="FNanchor_1627_1627" id="FNanchor_1627_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a> It is hardly worth while to enumerate the whole list of more general historical
treatises of the sixteenth and even seventeenth centuries,<a name="FNanchor_1628_1628" id="FNanchor_1628_1628"></a><a href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a> which bring this famous voyage
within their scope. It seems clear, however, that Oviedo had some sources which are not
recognizable now, and some have contended that he had access to Magellan’s own papers.
Herrera in the ninth book of his eleventh Decade in the same way apparently had information
the sources of which are now lost to us. The story of Magellan necessarily made
part of such books as Osorius’s <i>De Rebus Emmanuelis gestis</i>, published at Cologne in
1581, again in 1597, and in Dutch at Rotterdam in 1661-1663. Burton in his <i>Hans Stade</i>
(p. lxxxvi) calls the <i>Relacion y derrotero del Viaje y descubrimiento del estrecho de la
Madre de Dios, antes llamado de Magallanes por Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa</i>, published
in 1580, an unworthy attempt to rob Magellan of his fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span></p>

<p>The modern studies of Magellan and his career have been in good hands. Navarrete
when he made his most important contribution of material, accompanied it with
a very careful <i>Noticia biográfica</i> of Magellan, in which he makes exact references to his
sources.<a name="FNanchor_1629_1629" id="FNanchor_1629_1629"></a><a href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a></p>

<p>A critical life of Magellan was prefixed by Lord Stanley to his Hakluyt Society volume
in 1874. R. H. Major in his <i>Prince Henry the Navigator</i> included an admirable critical
account, which was repeated in its results in his later volume, <i>Discoveries of Prince
Henry</i>.</p>

<p>A paper on the search of Magellan and of Gomez for a western passage was read
by Buckingham Smith before the New York Historical Society, a brief report of which
is in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, x. (1866) 229; and one may compare with it the essay
by Langeron in the <i>Revue Géographique</i> in 1877.</p>

<p>A number of more distinctive monographs have also been printed, beginning with the
<i>Magellan, oder die Erste Reise um die Erde nach dem vorhanderen Quellen dargestellt</i> of
August Bürck, which was published in Leipsic in 1844.<a name="FNanchor_1630_1630" id="FNanchor_1630_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a> Dr. Kohl, who had given the
subject much study, particularly in relation to the history of the straits which Magellan
passed, published the results of his researches in the <i>Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für
Erdkunde in Berlin</i> in 1877,&mdash;a treatise which was immediately republished separately
as <i>Geschichte der Entdeckungsreisen und Schiffahrten zur Magellan’s Strasse</i>. In 1881
Dr. Franz Wieser, a professor in the University at Innspruck, examined especially the
question of any anterior exploration in this direction, in his <i>Magalhâes-strasse und
Austral Continent auf den globen des Johannes Schöner</i>, which was published in that
year at Innspruck.<a name="FNanchor_1631_1631" id="FNanchor_1631_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a> About the same time (1881) the Royal Academy at Lisbon printed
a <i>Vida e Viagens de Fernão de Magalhães, com um appendice original</i>, which, as the
work of Diego de Barros Arana, had already appeared in Spanish.</p>

<p>The bibliography of Magellan and his voyage is prepared with some care by Charton in
his <i>Voyageurs</i>, p. 353; and scantily in St. Martin’s <i>Histoire de la Géographie</i>, p. 370.</p>

An overcrowding of archives in the keeping
of the Council of the Indies was sometimes
relieved by sending part of them to Simancas.
Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, i. 281. Harrisse,
<i>Christophe Colomb</i>, i. 33, says all, or nearly all,
the papers relating to Columbus have been removed
to Seville.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a></span>
Some of the documents at Simancas and
in other repositories, beginning with 1485, have
been edited in the Rolls Series (published for
the English Government) by G. A. Bergenroth
and by Gayangos (London, 1862-1879), in the
<i>Calendar of Letters, Despatches, and State Papers
relating to Negotiations between England and
Spain</i>, contained in five volumes. Vol. i. comes
through 1509; and the first paper in it is a complaint
of Ferdinand and Isabella against Columbus
for his participancy in the piratical service
of the French in 1485. Various documents from
the archives of Simancas are given in Alaman’s
<i>La República Megicana</i>, three volumes,
1844-1849. We get glimpses in the <i>Historia</i>
of Las Casas of a large number of the letters
of Columbus, to which he must have had access,
but which are now lost. Harrisse thinks it was
at Simancas, that Las Casas must have found
them; for when engaged on that work he was
living within two leagues of that repository.
It seems probable, also, that Las Casas must
have had use of the Biblioteca Colombina,
when it was deposited in the convent of San
Pablo (1544-1552), from whose Dominican
monks Harrisse thinks it possible that Las
Casas obtained possession of the Toscanelli
map. He regrets, however, that for the personal
history of Columbus and his family, Las
Casas furnishes no information which cannot
be found more nearly at first hand elsewhere.
See Harrisse, <i>Christophe Colomb</i>, i. 122, 125-127,
129, 133.</p>

Robertson prefixes to his <i>History</i> a list of
the Spanish books and manuscripts which he
had used.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“The English reader,” writes Irving in
1828, when he had published his own <i>Life of
Columbus</i>, “hitherto has derived his information
almost exclusively from the notice of Columbus
in Dr. Robertson’s <i>History</i>; this, though admirably
executed, is but a general outline.”&mdash;<i>Life
of Irving</i>, ii. 313.</p>

Harrisse, <i>Christophe Colomb</i>, i. 35. He also
refers to the notarial records preserved at Seville,
as having been but partially explored for elucidations
of the earliest exploration. He found
among them the will of Diego, the younger
brother of Columbus (p. 38). Alfred Demersay
printed in the <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie</i>,
June, 1864, a paper, “Une mission geographique
dans les archives d’Espagne et de Portugal,”
in which he describes, particularly as regards
their possessions of documents relating to
America, the condition at that time of the
archives of the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon
(of which, after 1842 and till his death, Santarem
was archivist); those of the Kingdom of
Aragon at Barcelona, and of the Indies at
Seville; and the collections of Muñoz, embracing
ninety-five vols. in folio, and thirty-two in
quarto, and of Mata-Lanares, included in eighty
folios, in the Academy of History at Madrid.
He refers for fuller details to Tiran’s <i>Archives
d’Aragon et de Simancas</i> (1844), and to Joáo
Pedro Ribeiro’s <i>Memorias Authenticas para a
Historia do real Archivo</i>, Lisbon, 1819.</p>

Harrisse, in his <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 5,
describes a collection of manuscripts which were
sold by Obadiah Rich, in 1848 or 1849, to James
Lenox, of New York, which had been formed
by Uguina, the friend of Muñoz. There is in
the Academy of History at Madrid a collection
of documents said to have been formed by
Don Vargas Ponçe.</p>

Harrisse (<i>Christophe Columb</i>, i. 65) refers
to an unpublished fragment in the Lenox Library.
The <i>Ticknor Catalogue</i> (p. 244) shows a
discourse on Muñoz read before the Academy
of History in 1833, as well as a criticism by
Iturri on his single volume. Harrisse (<i>Christophe
Colomb</i>, i. 65) gives the titles of other
controversial publications on the subject of
Muñoz’s history. Muñoz died in 1799. It is
usually said that the Spanish Government prevented
the continuation of his work.</p>

See <i>post</i>, p. 77. A third copy, made by
Columbus’ direction was sent to his factor in
Hispaniola, Alonzo Sanchez de Carvajal. This
is not known; and Harrisse does not show that
the archives of Santo Domingo offer much of
interest of so early a date. A fourth copy was
deposited in the monastery of the Cuevas at
Seville, and is probably the one which his son,
Diego, was directed to send to Gaspar Gorricio.

This book was reprinted at Genoa in 1857,
with additions, edited by Giuseppe Banchero,
and translated into English, and published in
1823 in London, as <i>Memorials of a Collection of
Authentic Documents</i>, etc. A Spanish edition
was issued at Havana in 1867 (Leclerc, nos.
134, 135). Wagner, in his <i>Colombo und seine
Entdeckungen</i> (Leipsic, 1825), makes use of
Spotorno, and translates the letters. These
and other letters are also given in Torre’s
<i>Scritti di Colombo</i>; in the <i>Lettere autografe di

Leclerc says it is “difficile à trouver,” and

citations and references in Allibone’s <i>Dictionary</i>,
942, and Poole’s <i>Index</i>, p. 280. A portion, at
least, of the manuscript of the book is in existence

Collections like that of Icazbalceta on
Mexico may be barely mentioned in this place,
since their characteristics can better be defined
in more special relations. Prescott had eight
thousand manuscript pages of copies of documents
relating to Mexico and Peru. Cf. Preface
to his <i>Mexico</i>. In 1792 Father Manuel de la
Vega collected in Mexico thirty-two folio volumes
of papers, in obedience to an order of the
Spanish Government to gather all documents
to be found in New Spain “fitted to illustrate
the antiquities, geography, civil, ecclesiastical,
and natural history of America,” and transmit
copies of them to Madrid (Prescott, Mexico,
iii. 409).</p>

This book was privately printed (ninety-five
copies) for Mr. S. L. M. Barlow, of New
York. It has thrice, at least, occurred in sales
(Menzies, no. 894,&mdash;$57.50; J. J. Cooke,
vol. iii. no. 580; Brinley, no. 17). It is an
extremely valuable key to the documentary and
printed references on Columbus’ career. To
a very small number (nine) of a separate issue
of the portion relating to the letters of Columbus,
a new Preface was added in 1865. Cf.
Ernest Desjardin’s <i>Rapport sur les deux ouvrages
de bibliographie Américaine de M. Henri
Harrisse</i> (Paris, 1867, p. 8), extracted from the
<i>Bullétin de la Société de Géographie</i>. The article
on Columbus in Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i> (iv. 274,
etc.) is based on Harrisse, with revisions. Cf.
references in H. H. Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>,
i. 238; Saint-Martin, <i>Histoire de la géographie</i>
(1873), p. 319; F. G. Cancellieri’s <i>Dessertazioni
epistolari bibliografiche sopra Colombo</i>, etc.

The Archives of Venice, at the beginning
of this century, contained memorials of Columbus
which can no longer be found (Marin,
<i>Storia civile e politica del commercio de’ Veneziani</i>,
Venezia, 1800; Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet. Additions</i>,
p. xxi). This is perhaps owing to the
Austrian depredation upon the Venetian archives
in the Frari and Marciana in 1803-1805,
and in 1866. Not a little, however, of use has
been preserved in the <i>Calendar of State Papers
in the Archives of Venice</i> published by the British
Government, in the Rolls Series, since 1864.
They primarily illustrate English history, but
afford some light upon American affairs. Only
six volumes (the last volume in three parts)
have been printed. Mr. Rawdon Brown, who
edited them, long a resident of Italy, dying at
Venice, Aug. 25, 1883, at eighty, has sent, during
his labors in this field, one hundred and twenty-six
volumes of manuscript copies to the English
Public Record Office.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a></span>
Of these, twenty-nine are also given in fac-simile;
there are besides about two hundred and
fifty fac-similes of autographs. The volume is
priced at 150 marks and 300 francs. Cf. Leclerc,
no. 2,688. H. H. Bancroft (<i>Mexico</i>, ii. 606) says
of the volume: “There are about two hundred
and twenty-four pages of geographical notes,
vocabulary, biographical data, a glossary, and
cuts, maps, and indexes. The letters and fac-similes,
from the first to the last, are valuable
in a historic sense, and the vocabulary is useful;
but the biographical and historical data
are not always reliable, numerous errors having
been detected in comparing with official records
and with memoranda of witnesses of the
events related.” Mr. Bancroft’s own library is
said to contain twelve hundred volumes of manuscript
amassed for his own work; but a large
portion of them, it is supposed, do not concern
the Spanish history of the Pacific coast.</p>

Mr. Dexter, a graduate of Harvard in 1858,
after most serviceable labors as Recording Secretary
of the Massachusetts Historical Society, resigned
that position on account of ill health, and
died at Santa Barbara, California, Dec. 18, 1883.
The <i>Proceedings</i> of the Society for January, 1884,
contain tributes to his memory. Various communications
in earlier volumes of the same
<i>Proceedings</i> show the painstaking of his research,
and the accuracy of his literary method. The
first chapter in Vol. IV. of the present <i>History</i>
was his last effort in historical study, and he
did not live to correct the proofs. His death
has narrowed the circle of those helpful friends
who have been ever ready to assist the Editor
in his present labors.</p>

An Italian version of the letters of Columbus
and Vespucius, with fac-similes of the letters
(<i>Tre lettere di Colombo ed Vespucci</i>), edited
by Augusto Zeri, was printed (six hundred copies)
at Rome in 1881. Cf. <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>,

Ferdinand Columbus tried to make his
readers believe that his father was of some kinship
with this corsair. The story of Columbus
escaping on an oar from a naval fight off Cape
St. Vincent, and entering Portugal by floating to
the shore, does not agree with known facts in his
life of the alleged date. (Harrisse, <i>Les Colombo</i>,
p. 36.) Allegri Allegretti, in his <i>Ephemerides
Senenses ab anno 1450 usque ad 1496</i> (in Muratori,
xxiii. 827), gives a few particulars regarding the
early life of Columbus. (Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>,
p. 41.) Some of the latest researches
upon his piratical life are given by Rawdon
Brown in the <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, 1864,
covering 1202-1509, vol. i.</p>

Prescott (<i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, ed. 1873,
vol. ii. p. 123) says: “The discrepancies among
the earliest authorities are such as to render
hopeless any attempt to settle with precision
the chronology of Columbus’s movements previous
to his first voyage.”</p>

It cannot but be remarked how Italy, in
Columbus, Cabot, and Vespucius, not to name
others, led in opening the way to a new stage in
the world’s progress, which by making the
Atlantic the highway of a commerce that had
mainly nurtured Italy on the Mediterranean,
conduced to start her republics on that decline
which the Turk, sweeping through that inland
sea, confirmed and accelerated.</p>

Notwithstanding this disappointment of
Columbus, it is claimed that Alfonso V., in 1474,
had consulted Toscanelli as to such a western
passage “to the land where the spices grow.”</p>

There is great uncertainty about this English
venture. Benzoni says Columbus’s ideas
were ridiculed; Bacon (<i>Life of Henry VII.</i>)
says the acceptance of them was delayed by
accident; Purchas says they were accepted too
late. F. Cradock, in the Dedication of his
<i>Wealth Discovered</i>, London, 1661, regrets the
loss of honor which Henry VII. incurred in not
listening to the project. (Sabin, v. 55.) There is
much confusion of statement in the early writers.

There are two views of Seville in Braun
and Hogenberg’s <i>Civitates orbis terrarum</i>, published
at Antwerp in 1572, and again at Brussels
(in French) in 1574. In one of the engravings
a garden near the Puerta de Goles is marked
“Guerta de Colon;” and in the other the words
“Casa de Colon” are attached to the top of one
of the houses. Muller, <i>Books on America</i>, 1877,

Palos is no longer a port, such has been
the work of time and tide. In 1548 the port is
described in Medina’s <i>Libro de grandezas y cosas
de España</i>. (Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 281.)
Irving described it in 1828. Its present unmaritime
character is set forth by E. E. Hale in <i>Amer.

p. 17; and <i>Overland Monthly</i>, Jan., 1883, p. 42.</p>

Cf. Irving, app. no. xvi., on the route of
Columbus. Brevoort in his <i>Verrazzano</i>, p. 101,
describes the usual route of the early navigators
from Spain to the West Indies. Columbus kept
two records of his progress. One was an unworthily
deceitful one (reminding us of an earlier
deceit, when he tampered with the compass to
mislead his crew), by which he hoped to check
the apprehensions of his men arising from his increasing
longitude; and the other a dead reckoning
of some kind, in which he thought he was
approximately accurate. The story of his capitulating
to his crew, and agreeing
to turn back in three days
in case land was not reached,
is only told by Oviedo on the
testimony of a pilot hostile to
Columbus.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a></span>
It may have been on some
island or in some canoe; or
just as likely a mere delusion.
The fact that Columbus at a
later day set up a claim for
the reward for the first discovery
on the strength of this
mysterious light, to the exclusion
of the poor sailor who
first actually saw land from
the “Pinta,” has subjected his
memory, not unnaturally, to
some discredit at least with
those who reckon magnanimity
among the virtues. Cf.
<i>Navarrete</i>, iii. 612.</p>

The prayer used was
adopted later in similar cases,
under Balboa, Cortes, Pizarro,
etc. It is given in C. Clemente’s

Humboldt in his <i>Cosmos</i> (English translation,
ii. 422) has pointed out how in this first
voyage the descriptions by Columbus of tropical
scenes convince one of the vividness of his
impressions and of the quickness of his observation.</p>

Pinzon’s heirs at a later day manifested
hostility to Columbus, and endeavored to magnify
their father’s importance in the voyage. Cf.
Irving, App. x. In the subsequent lawsuit for
the confirmation of Columbus’s right, the Pinzons
brought witnesses to prove that it was their
urgency which prevented Columbus from giving
up the voyage and turning back.</p>

There is a wide difference as reported by
the early writers as to the number of men which
Columbus had with him on this voyage. Ferdinand
Columbus says ninety; Peter Martyr, one
hundred and twenty; others say one hundred
and eighty. The men he left at Hayti are reckoned
variously at thirty-nine, forty-three, forty-eight,
fifty-five, etc. Major, <i>Select Letters</i>, p. 12,
reckons them as from thirty-seven to forty. The
lists show among them an Irishman, “Guillermo
Ires, natural de Galney, en Irlanda,” and an
Englishman, “Tallarte de Lajes, Ingles.” These
are interpreted to mean William Herries&mdash;probably
“a namesake of ours,” says Harrisse&mdash;and
Arthur Lake. Bernaldez says he carried back
with him to Spain ten of the natives.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a></span>
The line of 1494 gave Portugal, Brazil, the
Moluccas, the Philippines, and half of New
Guinea. Jurien de la Gravière, <i>Les marins du

Navarrete, ii. 143. It is the frequent recurrence
of such audacious and arrogant acts on
the part of Columbus which explains his sad
failure as an administrator, and seriously impairs
the veneration in which the world would
rejoice to hold him.</p>

The question of the priority of Columbus’
discovery of the mainland over Vespucius is
discussed in the following chapter. M. Herrera
is said to have brought forward, at the Congrès
des Américanistes held at Copenhagen in 1883,
new evidence of Columbus’s landing on the mainland.
Father Manoel de la Vega, in his <i>Historia
del descobrimiento de la America septentrional</i>,
first published in Mexico in 1826 by Bustamante,
alleges that Columbus in this southern
course was intending to test the theory of King
John of Portugal, that land blocked a westerly
passage in that direction.</p>

Helps says: “The greatest geographical
discoveries have been made by men conversant
with the book-knowledge of their own time.”
The age of Columbus was perhaps the most illustrious
of ages. “Where in the history of nations,”
says Humboldt, “can one find an epoch so
fraught with such important results as the discovery
of America, the passage to the East Indies
round the Cape of Good Hope, and Magellan’s
first circumnavigation, simultaneously occurring
with the highest perfection of art, the attainment
of intellectual and religious freedom, and
with the sudden enlargement of the knowledge
of the earth and the heavens?” <i>Cosmos</i>, Eng.

This manuscript is the <i>Libro de las profecias</i>,
of which parts are printed in Navarrete. Cf.
Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 156, who calls it
a “curious medley of quotations and puerile inferences;”
and refers for an analysis of it to
Gallardo’s <i>Ensayo</i>, ii. 500. Harrisse thinks the
hand is that of Ferdinand Columbus when a boy,
and that it may have been written under the
Admiral’s direction.</p>

Ferdinand Columbus says that the Arab
astronomer, Al Fergani, influenced Columbus
to the same end; and these views he felt
were confirmed by the reports of Marco Polo
and Mandeville. Cf. Yule’s <i>Marco Polo</i>. vol. i.

By a great circle course the distance would
have been reduced to something short of five
thousand eight hundred miles. (Fox in <i>U. S.

Polo had not distinctly said how far off the coast
of China the Island of Cipango lay.</p>

to have shared Behaim’s views and both
were mainly in accord with Toscanelli. Humboldt,

Not long from the time of his first voyage
the <i>Orbis breviarium</i> of Lilius, which later
passed through other editions and translations,
summarized the references of the ancients
(Stevens, <i>Bibl. Geog.</i> no. 1,670). But Harrisse,
<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 180, holds that the earliest
instance of the new found islands being
declared the parts known to the ancients, and
referred to by Virgil in the 6th book of the
Æneid,&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfp6 p1">“Jacet extra sidera tellus,” etc.,</p>

in placing the 1472 edition of Strabo’s <i>De Situ
orbis</i> in his American collection, pointed to the
belief of this ancient geographer in the existence
of the American continent as a habitable
part of the globe, as shown when he says:
“Nisi Atlantici maris obstaret magnitudo, posse
nos navigare per eundem parallelum ex Hispania

most popular of the condensed cosmographical
works of the time; and it gave but the briefest
reference to the New World, “de regionibus
extra Ptolemæum.” Its author was under thirty
when he published his first edition in 1527 at
Basle. There is a copy in the Carter-Brown
Library (<i>Catalogue</i>, i. 90). Cf. also <i>Bibl. Amer.
Vet.</i>, 142; Huth, ii. 602; Weigel, 1877, p. 82,

the next year, 1528 (Trömel, 3), and again in
1529. (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, 143, 147.) Another
edition was printed at Freiburg (Brisgau) in
1530, of which there are copies in Harvard College
and Carter-Brown (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 95) libraries.
(Cf. <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, 147; Muller, 1877,
no. 1,232.) There were other Freiburg imprints
in 1533, 1536, 1539, 1543, and 1551. (<i>Bibl. Amer.

<i>Buchersaal</i>, i. 79.) An edition of Venice, without
date, is assigned to 1549. (<i>Catalogue of the
Sumner Collection in Harvard College Library.</i>)
Editions were issued at Paris in 1542, with a
folded map, “Typus cosmographicus universalis,”
in 1550 (Court, 144), and in 1572, the
last repeating the map. (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, 139.)

Bernaldez tells us that Columbus was a
reader of Ptolemy and of John de Mandeville.
Cf. on the spreading of Ptolemy’s views at
this time Lelewel, <i>Géographie du moyen âge</i>, ii. p.
122; Thomassy, <i>Les papes géographes</i>, pp. 15, 34.
There are copies of the 1475 edition of Ptolemy
in the Library of Congress and the Carter-Brown
Library (cf. also <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, no. 2,044); of
the 1478 edition, the only copy in this country,
so far as known, is the one in the Carter-Brown
Library, added to that collection since its catalogue
was printed. The Perkins copy in 1873
brought £80 (cf. <i>Livres payés en vente publique
1,000 francs</i>, etc., p. 137). It was the first edition
with maps. Lelewel (vol. ii. p. 124) had traced
the influence of the Agathodæmon (Ptolemean)
maps on the cartography of the Middle Ages.
The maps representing the growth of geographical
ideas anterior to Columbus will be examined
in another place. The Ulm edition of
Ptolemy, 1482, showed in its map of the world
a part of what is now called America in representing
Greenland; but it gave it a distinct relation
to Europe, by making Greenland a peninsula
of the Scandinavian north. There seems reason
to believe that this map was made in 1471, and
it passes for the earliest engraved map to show
that northern region,&mdash;“Engrone-land,” as it is
called. If we reject the Zeno map with its alleged
date of 1400 or thereabout (published long after
Columbus, in 1558), the oldest known delineations
of Greenland (which there is no evidence
that Columbus ever saw, and from which if he
had seen them, he could have inferred nothing to
advantage) are a Genoese manuscript map in the
Pitti palace, which Santarem (<i>Histoire de la Cartographie</i>,
vol. iii. p. xix) dates 1417, but which
seems instead to be properly credited to 1447,
the peninsula here being “Grinlandia” (cf. Lelewel,
<i>Epilogue</i>, p. 167; <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, April, 1883, p. 290); and the map of
Claudius Clavus, assigned to 1427, which belongs
to a manuscript of Ptolemy, preserved in
the library at Nancy. This, with the Zeno map
and that in the Ptolemy of 1482, is given in
<i>Trois cartes précolombiennes représentant Groenland,
fac-simile présentés au Congrès des Américanistes
à Copenhague; par A. E. Nordenskiöld</i>,
Stockholm, 1883. In the Laon globe (1486-1487)
“Grolandia” is put down as an island off the
Norway coast. There is a copy of this 1482
edition of Ptolemy in the Carter-Brown Library,
and another is noted in the <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>,
no. 2,046. Its maps were repeated in the 1486
edition, also published at Ulm; and of this
there was a copy in the Murphy Collection
(no. 2,047,&mdash;bought by President White, of Cornell);
and another belongs to the late G. W. Riggs,
of Washington. In 1490 the Roman edition of
1478 was reproduced with the same maps; and
of this there is a copy in the Carter-Brown Library;
and another is shown in the <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>
(no. 2,048). A splendidly illuminated copy
of this edition sold in the Sunderland sale (part
v. no. 13,770) has since been held by Quaritch
at <i>£</i>600. See further on these early editions of
Ptolemy in Winsor’s <i>Bibliography of Ptolemy’s
Geography</i>, published by Harvard University.</p>

Humboldt, <i>Examen Critique</i>, i. 61, 65, 70;
ii. 349. Columbus quoted this passage in October,
1498, in his letter from Santo Domingo to
the Spanish monarch. Margry, <i>Navigations
Françaises</i>, Paris, 1867, p. 71, “Les deux Indes
du XV<sup>e</sup> siècle et l’influence Française sur Colomb,”
has sought to reflect credit on his country
by tracing the influence of the <i>Imago mundi</i> in
the discovery of the New World; but the borrowing
from Bacon destroys his case. (Major,
<i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>, p. xlvii; Harrisse,
<i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 84.) If Margry’s claim
is correct, that there was an edition of the
<i>Imago mundi</i> printed at Nuremberg in 1472, it
would carry it back of the beginning of Columbus’s
advocacy of his views; but bibliographers
find no edition earlier than 1480 or 1483, and
most place this <i>editio princeps</i> ten years later
as Humboldt does. It is generally agreed that
the book was written in 1410. A copy of this
first edition, of whatever date, is preserved in
the Colombina Library in Seville; and it was
the copy used by Columbus and Las Casas. Its
margins are annotated, and the notes, which are
by most thought to be in the hand of Columbus,
have been published by Varnhagen in the <i>Bulletin
de la Société de Géographie de Paris</i>, January,
1858, p. 71, and by Peschel in his <i>Geschichte des
Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>, p. 112,&mdash;who, however,
ascribes the notes to Bartholomew Columbus.
A fac-simile of part of them is given on
p. 31. Cf. Major, <i>Prince Henry</i>, p. 349; Carter-Brown,

Mandeville had made his Asiatic journey
and long sojourn (thirty-four years) thirty or forty
years later than Marco Polo, and on his return
had written his narrative in English, French, and
Latin. It was first printed in French at Lyons,
in 1480. The narrative is, however, unauthentic.</p>

There were other editions between his first

of a manuscript of the fourteenth century
of the <i>Livre de Marco Polo</i> was prepared under

The Italian text of Toscanelli’s
letter has been long
known in Ferdinand Columbus’
Life of his father; but
Harrisse calls it “très-inexact
et interpolée;” and, in his <i>Bibl.
Am. Vet. Additions</i> (1872), p.
xvi, Harrisse gives the Latin
text, which he had already
printed, in 1871, in his <i>Don
Fernando Colon</i>, published at
Seville, from a copy made of it
which had been discovered by
the librarian of the Colombina,
transcribed by Columbus himself
in a copy of Æneas Sylvius’
(Pius II.’s) <i>Historia rerum
ubique gestarum</i>, Venice, 1477,
preserved in that library. Harrisse
also gives a photographic
fac-simile of this memorial of
Columbus. Cf. D’Avezac, in
the <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie de Paris</i>,
October, 1873, p. 46; and Harrisse, <i>Les Cortereal</i>,
p. 41. The form of the letter, as given in Navarrete,
is translated into English in Kettell’s <i>Journal
of Columbus</i>, p. 268, and in Becher’s <i>Landfall
of Columbus</i>, p. 183. Cf. Lelewel, <i>Géographie du
moyen âge</i>, ii. 130; <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie</i>,
1872, p. 49; Ruge, <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters
der Entdeckungen</i>, p. 225. H. Grothe, in
his <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i>, Berlin, 1874, says that
Da Vinci in 1473 had written to Columbus respecting
a western passage to the Indies.</p>

Humboldt sees no reason to doubt that Iceland
was meant. (<i>Examen critique</i>, i. 105; v. 213;
<i>Cosmos</i>, ii. 611.) It may be remarked, however,
that “Thyle” and “Islanda” are both laid down
in the Ptolemy map of 1486, which only signifies
probably that the old and new geography were
not yet brought into accord. Cf. <i>Journal of
the American Geographical Society</i>, xii. 170, 177,
where it is stated that records prove the mild
winter for Iceland in 1477, which Columbus represents
at Thule.</p>

A like intimation is sustained by De Costa
in <i>Columbus and the Geographers of the North</i>,
Hartford, 1872; and it is distinctly claimed in

Harrisse, <i>Les Cortereals</i>, p. 25, who points
out that Behaim’s globe shows nothing of such
a voyage,&mdash;which it might well have done if the
voyage had been made; for Behaim had lived at
the Azores, while Cortereal was also living on a
neighboring island. Major, <i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>,
p. xxviii, shows that Faria y Sousa, in
<i>Asia Portuguesa</i>, while giving a list of all expeditions
of discovery from Lisbon, 1412-1460,
makes no mention of this Cortereal. W. D.
Cooley, in his <i>Maritime and Island Discovery</i>,
London, 1830, follows Barrow; but Paul Barron
Watson, in his “Bibliography of pre-Columbian
Discoveries” appended to the 3d edition (Chicago,
1883) of Anderson’s <i>America not discovered
by Columbus</i>, p. 158, indicates how Humboldt
(<i>Examen critique</i>, i. 279), G. Folsom (<i>North
American Review</i>, July, 1838), Gaffarel (<i>Études</i>,
p. 328), Kohl (<i>Discovery of Maine</i>, p. 165), and
others dismiss the claim. If there was any truth
in it, it would seem that Portugal deliberately
cut herself off from the advantages of it in accepting
the line of demarcation in 1493.</p>

<i>America not discovered by Columbus</i>, p. 164.
Estancelin, in his <i>Recherches sur les voyages et
découvertes des navigateurs Normands en Afrique,
dans les Indes orientales, et en Amérique; suivies
d’observations sur la marine, le commerce, et les
établissemens coloniaux des Français</i>, Paris, 1832,
claims that Pinzon, represented as a companion
of Cousin, was one of the family later associated
with Columbus in his voyage in 1492. Léon
Guérin, in <i>Navigateurs Français</i>, 1846, mentions
the voyage, but expresses no opinion. Parkman,
<i>Pioneers of France</i>, p. 169, does not wholly discredit
the story. Paul Gaffarel, <i>Étude sur les
rapports de l’Amérique et de l’ancien continent
avant Colomb</i>, Paris, 1869, and <i>Découverte du
Brésil par Jean Cousin</i>, Paris, 1874, advocates
the claim. Again, in his <i>Histoire du Brésil Français</i>,
Paris, 1878, Gaffarel considers the voyage
geographically and historically possible. (Cf.
also a paper by him in the <i>Revue politique et littéraire</i>,
2 mai, 1874.) It is claimed that the white
and bearded men whom, as Las Casas says, the
natives of Hispaniola had seen before the coming
of the Spaniards, were the companions of
Cousin. Cf. Vitet’s <i>Histoire de Dieppe</i>, Paris,

Watson’s <i>Bibliography of pre-Columbian
Discoveries of America</i>, p. 161, enumerates the
contestants; and Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, nos.
13, 14, epitomizes the authorities. The earliest
reference, after Schedel, seems to be one in
Guillaume Postel’s <i>Cosmographicæ disciplinæ compendium</i>,
Basle, 1561, in which a strait below
South America is named Behaim’s Strait; but
J. Chr. Wagenseil, in his <i>Sacra parentalia</i>, 1682,
earliest urged the claim, which he repeated in
his <i>Historia universalis</i>, while it was reinforced
in Stüven’s or Stuvenius’ <i>De vero novi orbis
inventore</i>, Frankfort, 1714. (Copy in Harvard
College Library; cf. Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no.
195.) The first important counter-argument appeared
in E. Tozen’s <i>Der wahre und erste
Entdecker der Neuen Welt, Christoph Colon,
gegen die ungegründeten Ausprüche, welche Americus
Vespucci and Martin Behaim auf diese Ehre
machen, vertheidiget</i>, Göttingen, 1761. (Sabin,
xii. 489.) Robertson rejected the claim; and so,
in 1778, did C. G. von Murr, in his <i>Diplomatische
Geschichte des Ritters Behaim</i>, published at Nuremberg
(2d ed., Gotha, 1801; Jansen’s French
translation, Paris, 1801 and Strasburg, 1802;
also appended to Amoretti’s <i>Pigafetta</i>; English
in Pinkerton’s <i>Voyages</i>, 1812). A letter from
Otto to Benjamin Franklin, in the <i>American
Philosophical Society’s Transactions</i>, 1786, ii. 263,
urged the theory. Dr. Belknap, in 1792, in
the Appendix to his <i>Discourse on Columbus</i>,
dismissed it. Cladera, in his <i>Investigaciones
históricas sobre los principales descubrimientos
de los Españoles</i>, Madrid, 1794, was decidedly
averse, replying to Otto, and adding a translation
of Von Murr’s essay. (Leclerc, nos. 118,
2,505.) Amoretti, in his Preface to <i>Pigafetta’s
Voyage</i>, Paris, 1801, argues that Columbus’
discoveries convinced Behaim of his own by
comparison. Irving says the claim is founded
on a misinterpretation of the Schedel passage.
Humboldt, in his <i>Examen critique</i>, i. 256, enters
into a long adverse argument. Major, in his
<i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>, and in his <i>Prince
Henry</i>, is likewise decided in opposition. Ghillany,
in his <i>Geschichte des Seefahrers Ritter
Martin Behaim</i>, is favorable. Gaffarel, <i>Étude
sur les rapports de l’Amérique et de l’ancien continent
avant Colomb</i>, Paris, 1869, is sceptical.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It seems to be a fact that Behaim made a
map showing the straits passed by Magellan,
which Pigafetta refers to; and it is also clear
that Schöner, in globes made earlier, also indicated
a similar strait; and Schöner might well
have derived his views from Behaim. What we
know of Behaim’s last years, from 1494 to 1506,
is not sufficient to fill the measure of these
years; and advocates are not wanting who assign
to them supposed voyages, on one of which
he might have acquired a personal knowledge
of the straits which he delineated. Such advocates
are met, and will continue to be answered,
with the likelier supposition, as is claimed, of
the Straits in question being a happy guess,
both on Behaim’s and Schöner’s part, derived
from the analogy of Africa,&mdash;a southern extremity
which Behaim had indeed delineated on
his globe some years before its actual discovery,
though not earlier than the existence of a
prevalent belief in such a Strait. Cf. Wieser,
<i>Magalhâes-Strasse</i>.</p>

Charton (<i>Voyageurs</i>, iii. 75) gives a partial
bibliography of the literature of the discovery
and conquest. The best English book is Major’s
<i>Conquest of the Canaries</i>, published by the
Hakluyt Society, London, 1872, which is a translation,
with notes, of the Béthencourt narrative;
and the same author has epitomized the story
in chapter ix. of his <i>Discoveries of Prince Henry</i>.
There is an earlier English book, George Glas’s
<i>Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands</i>,
London, 1764, 1767, which is said to be based
on an unpublished manuscript of 1632, the work
of a Spanish monk, J. de Abreu de Galineo, in
the island of Palma. The Béthencourt account
was first published in Paris, 1630, with different
imprints, as <i>Histoire de la première descovverte et
conqueste des Canaries</i>. Dufossé prices it at from
250 to 300 francs. The original manuscript was
used in preparing the edition, <i>Le Canarien</i>, issued
at Rouen in 1874 by G. Gravier (Leclerc, no. 267).
This edition gives both a modern map and a
part of that of Mecia de Viladestes (1413);
enumerates the sources of the story; and
(p. lxvi) gives D’Avezac’s account of the preservation
of the Béthencourt manuscript. The
Spanish translation by Pedro Ramirez, issued
at Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1847, was rendered
from the Paris, 1630, edition.</p>

Collection</i>, part i. no. 19; and <i>Bibliography of
Ptolemy</i>, sub anno 1478. A sea-chart of Bartolomeus
de Pareto, A. D. 1455, shows “Antillia”
and an island farther west called “Roillo.” Antillia
is supposed also to have been delineated on
Toscanelli’s map in 1474. In 1476 Andreas Benincasa’s
portolano, given in Lelewel, pl. xxxiv.
and Saint-Martin, pl. vii. shows an island “Antilio;”
and again in the portolano belonging to
the Egerton manuscripts in the British Museum,
and supposed to represent the knowledge of
1489, just previous to Columbus’s voyage, and
thought by Kohl to be based on a Benincasa
chart of 1463, the conventional “Antillia” is
called “Y de Sete Zitade.” It is ascribed to
Christofalo Soligo. Behaim’s globe in 1492 also
gives “Insula Antilia genannt Septe Citade.” Cf.
Harrisse, <i>Les Cortereal</i>, p. 116. The name “Antilhas”
seems first to have been transferred from
this problematical mid-ocean island to the archipelago
of the West Indies by the Portuguese,
for Columbus gave no general name to the
group.</p>

Portugal might answer that she did both,”&mdash;referring

Sept. 13, 1492. In the latter part of the
sixteenth century, for a similar reason, St. Michael’s
in the Azores was taken for the first meridian,
but the no-variation then observable at that

twenty-five degrees.</p>

In 1495 Jaume Ferrer, who was called for
advice, sent a manuscript map to the Spanish
Monarchs to be used in the negotiations for
determining this question. (Navarrete; also
Amat, <i>Diccionario de los escritores Catalanes</i>.)
Jaume’s different treatises are collected by his
son in his <i>Sentencias cathólicas</i>, 1545. (Leclerc,
no. 2,765, 1,000 francs; Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Am. Vet.</i>,
no. 261; <i>Additions</i>, no. 154.) This contains
Jaime’s letter of Jan. 27, 1495, and the Monarchs’
reply of Feb. 28, 1495; and a letter written
at the request of Isabella from Burgos, Aug.
5, 1495, addressed to “Christofol Colō en la
gran Isla de Cibau.”</p>

<i>Ticknor Catalogue</i>, p. 387; Stevens, <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. i. no. 1,380; Sabin, iv. 277; Leclerc, no. 132. It was
noticed by Don Pascual de Gayangos in <i>La America</i>, April 13, 1867. Cf. another of Varnhagen’s publications,
<i>Carta de Cristóbal Colon enviada de Lisboa á Barcelona en Marzo de 1493</i>, published at Vienna in 1869. It has
a collation of texts and annotations (Leclerc, no. 131). A portion of the edition was issued with the additional
imprint, “Paris, Tross, 1870.” Of the 120 copies of this book, 60 were put in the trade. Major, referring
to these several Spanish texts, says: “I have carefully collated the three documents, and the result is a certain
conclusion that neither one nor the other is a correct transcript of the original letter,”&mdash;all having errors which
could not have been in the original. Major also translates the views on this point of Varnhagen, and enforces
his own opinion that the Spanish and Latin texts are derived from different though similar documents. Varnhagen
held the two texts were different forms of one letter. Harrisse dissents from this opinion in <i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet. Additions</i>, p. vi.</p>

Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, no. 126. The <i>Coronica de Aragon</i>, of Fabricius de Vagad, which was published
in 1499, makes reference to the new discoveries (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 9), as does the <i>Coronica
van Coellen</i>, published at Cologne, 1499, where, on the verso of folio 339, it speaks of “new lands found, in
which men roam like beasts” (Murphy, no. 254; Baer, <i>Incunabeln</i>, 1884, no. 172, at 160 marks; London Catalogue
(1884), £12 10<i>s.</i>). In 1498, at Venice, was published Marc. Ant. Sabellicus’ <i>In rapsodiam historiarum</i>
(copy in British Museum), which has a brief account of Columbus’ family and his early life. This was enlarged
in the second part, published at Venice in 1504 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 21). An anchor lost by Columbus on
this voyage, at Trinidad, is said to have been recovered in 1880 (<i>Bulletin de la Société Géographique d’Anvers</i>,
v. 515).</p>

Also, see <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 88, for a full account; and the reduced fac-simile of title in Carter-Brown, vol. i.
no. 51. The book is not very rare, though becoming so, since, as the French sale-catalogues say, referring to
the note, “Cette particularité fait de ce livre un objet de haute curiosité pour les collectionneurs Américains.”
Harrisse says of it: “Although prohibited, confiscated, and otherwise ill-treated by the Court of Rome and the
city authorities of Genoa, this work is frequently met with,&mdash;owing, perhaps, to the fact that two thousand
copies were printed, of which only five hundred found purchasers, while the fifty on vellum were distributed
among the sovereigns of Europe and Asia.” (Cf. Van Praet, <i>Catalogue des livres sur vélin</i>, i. 8.) Its price is,
however, increasing. Forty years ago Rich priced it at eighteen shillings. Recent quotations put it, in London
and Paris, at £7, 100 marks, and 110 francs. The Editor has used the copy in the Harvard College Library, and
in the Boston Public Library,&mdash;which last belonged to George Ticknor, who had used George Livermore’s copy
before he himself possessed the book. Ticknor’s <i>Spanish Literature</i>, i. 188; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, x. 431.</p>

On the question of the connection of Columbus with his second companion, Donna Beatrix Enriquez
who was of a respectable family in Cordova,&mdash;that there was a marriage tie has been claimed by Herrera,
Tiraboschi, Bossi, Roselly de Lorgues, Barry, and Cadoret (<i>Vie de Colomb</i>, Paris, 1869, appendix); and
that there was no such tie, by Napione (<i>Patria di Colombo</i> and Introduction to <i>Codice Colombo-Americano</i>),
Spotorno, Navarrete, Humboldt, and Irving. Cf. <i>Historical Magazine</i> (August, 1867), p. 225; <i>Revue des
questions historiques</i> (1879), <span class="smcap">xxv.</span> 213; Angelo Sanguinetti’s <i>Sull’origine di Ferdinando Colombo</i> (Genoa,
1876), p. 55; Giuseppe Antonio Dondero’s <i>L’onestá di Cristoforo Colombo</i> (Genoa, 1877), p. 213; Harrisse,
<i>Fernand Colomb</i>, p. 2; D’Avezac, in <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie</i> (1872), p. 19. It may be noted that
Ferdinand de Galardi, in dedicating his <i>Traité politique</i> (Leyden, 1660) to Don Pedro Colon, refers to Ferdinand
Colon as “Fernando Henriquez.” (Stevens, <i>Bibl. Geog.</i>, no. 1,147).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The inference from Columbus’ final testamentary language is certainly against the lady’s chastity. In his
codicil he enjoins his son Diego to provide for the respectable maintenance of the mother of Ferdinand, “for
the discharge of my conscience, for it weighs heavy on my soul.” Irving and others refer to this as the compunction
of the last hours of the testator. De Lorgues tries to show that this codicil was made April 1, 1502
(though others claim that the document of this date was another will, not yet found), and only copied at Segovia,
Aug. 25, 1505, and deposited in legal form with a notary at Valladolid, May 19, 1506. Columbus dying May 20,&mdash;the
effect of all which is only to carry back, much to Columbus’ credit, the compunction to an earlier date.
The will (1498), but not the codicil, is given in Irving, app. xxxiv. Cancellieri, in his <i>Dissertazioni</i>, gives
it imperfectly; but it is accurately given in the <i>Transactions</i> of the Genoa Academy. Cf. Harrisse (<i>Notes on
Columbus</i>) p. 160; Torre’s <i>Scritti di Colombo; Colon en Quisqueya</i>, Santo Domingo (1877), pp. 81, 99; <i>Cartas
y testamento</i>, Madrid, 1880; Navarrete, <i>Coleccion</i>; and elsewhere.</p>

De Lorgues, on the authority of Zúñiga (<i>Anales eclesiásticos</i>, p. 496), says he was born Aug. 29, 1487,
and not Aug. 15, 1488, as Navarrete and Humboldt had said. Harrisse (<i>Fernand Colomb</i>, p. 1) alleges the
authority of the executor of his will for the date Aug. 15, 1488. The inscription on his supposed grave would
make him born Sept. 28, 1488.</p>

Prescott (<i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, ii. 507) speaks of Ferdinand Columbus’ “experience and opportunities,
combined with uncommon literary attainments.” Harrisse calculates his income from the bequest of his
father, and from pensions, at about 180,000 francs of the present day. (<i>Fernand Colomb</i>, p. 29.)</p>

There has been close scrutiny of the publications of Europe in all tongues for the half century and more
following the sketch of Guistiniani in 1516, till the publication of the earliest considerable account of Columbus
in the Ulloa version of 1571, to gather some records of the growth or vicissitudes of the fame of the great discoverer,
and of the interest felt by the European public in the progress of events in the New World. Harrisse’s
<i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>, and his <i>Additions</i> to the same, give us the completest record down to 1550,
coupled with the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i> for the whole period.</p>

<p class="pfc4">There is a list of the books in B. Gallardo’s <i>Ensayo de una bibliotheca de libros españoles raros</i>. Harrisse
gives the fullest account of Ferdinand and his migrations, which can be in part traced by the inscriptions
in his books of the place of their purchase; for he had the habit of so marking them. Cf. a paper on Ferdinand,

Barcia says that Baliano began printing it simultaneously in Spanish, Italian, and Latin; but only the
Italian seems to have been completed, or at least is the only one known to bibliographers. (<i>Notes on Columbus</i>,
p. 24.) Oettinger (<i>Bibl. biog.</i>, Leipsic, 1850) is in error in giving an edition at Madrid in 1530. The 1571
Italian edition is very rare; there are copies in Harvard College, Carter-Brown, and Lenox libraries. Rich priced
it in 1832 at £1 10<i>s.</i> Leclerc (no. 138) prices it at 200 francs. The Sobolewski copy (no. 3,756) sold in 1873
for 285 francs, was again sold in 1884 in the Court Sale, no. 77. The <i>Murphy Catalogue</i> (no. 2,881) shows a
copy. This Ulloa version has since appeared somewhat altered, with several letters added,&mdash;in 1614 (Milan,
priced in 1832, by Rich, at £1 10<i>s.</i>; recently, at 75 francs; Carter-Brown, ii. 165); in 1676 (Venice, Carter-Brown,
vol. ii. no. 1,141, priced at 35 francs and 45 marks); in 1678 (Venice, Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,181,
priced at 50 francs); in 1681 (Paris, Court Sale, no. 79); in 1685 (Venice, Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,310,
priced at £1 8<i>s.</i>); and later, in 1709 (Harvard College Library), 1728, etc.; and for the last time in 1867,
revised by Giulio Antimaco, published in London, though of Italian manufacture. Cancellieri cites editions of
1618 and 1672. A French translation, <i>La Vie de Cristofle Colomb</i>, was made by Cotolendi, and published in
1681 at Paris. There are copies in the Harvard College and Carter-Brown (<i>Catalogue</i>, vol. ii. no. 1,215) libraries.
It is worth from $6 to $10. A new French version, “traduite et annotée par E. Muller,” appeared in Paris
in 1879, the editor calling the 1681 version “tronqué, incorrect, décharné, glacial.” An English version
appears in the chief collections of Voyages and Travels,&mdash;Churchill (ii. 479), Kerr (iii. 1), and Pinkerton
(xii. 1). Barcia gave it a Spanish dress after Ulloa’s, and this was printed in his <i>Historiadores primitivos
de las Indias occidentales</i>, at Madrid, in 1749, being found in vol. i. pp. 1-128. (Cf. Carter-Brown,

In comparing Rich’s (1832, £4 4<i>s.</i>) and recent prices, there does not seem to be much appreciation in the
value of the book during the last fifty years for ordinary copies; but Quaritch has priced the Beckford (no. 735,
copy so high as £52. There are copies in the Library of Congress, Carter-Brown, Harvard College, and Boston

Sabin, no. 31,539. This <i>Descripcion</i> was translated into Latin by Barlæus, and with other tracts joined
to it was printed at Amsterdam, in 1622, as <i>Novus orbis sive descriptio Indiæ occidentalis</i> (Carter-Brown)
vol. ii., no. 266; Sabin, no. 31,540; it is in our principal libraries, and is worth $10 or $15). It copies the
maps of the Madrid edition, and is frequently cited as Colin’s edition. The Latin was used in 1624 in part
by De Bry, part xii. of the <i>Grands voyages</i>. (Camus, pp. 147, 160; Tiele, pp. 56, 312, who followed other
engravings than Herrera’s for the Incas). There was a Dutch version, <i>Nieuwe Werelt</i>, by the same publisher,
in 1622 (Sabin, no. 31,542; Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 264), and a French (Sabin, no. 31,543; Carter-Brown,
vol. ii. no. 265; Rich, 1832, £1 10<i>s.</i>; Quaritch, £2 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>).</p>

hundred and thirty francs; Field, no. 689; ordinary copies are priced at £3 or £4; large paper at £10 or
£12). A rival but inferior edition was issued at Antwerp in 1728, without maps, and with De Bry’s instead
of Herrera’s engravings (Sabin, no. 31,545). A French version was begun at Paris in 1659, but was reissued
in 1660-1670 in three volumes (Sabin, nos. 31,548-31,550; Field, no. 690; Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 875;
Leclerc, no. 282, sixty francs), including only three decades. Portions were included in the Dutch collection of
Van der Aa (Sabin, nos. 31,551, etc.; Carter-Brown, iii. 111). It is also included in Hulsius, part xviii. (Carter-Brown,
i. 496). The English translation of the first three decades, by Captain John Stevens, is in six volumes,
London, 1725-1726; but a good many liberties are taken with the text (Sabin, no. 31,557; Carter-Brown,
vol. iii. no. 355). New titles were given to the same sheets, in 1740, for what is called a second edition (Sabin,
no. 31,558). “How many misstatements are attributed to Herrera which can be traced no nearer that author
than Captain John Stevens’s English translation? It is absolutely necessary to study this latter book to see
where so many English and American authors have taken incorrect facts” (H. Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca Hist.</i>,
p. xiii.).</p>

It appeared in the <i>Revue contemporaine</i>, xxiv. 484, and was drawn out by a paper on a newly discovered
portrait of Columbus, which had been printed by Jomard in the <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie</i>; by
Valentin Carderera’s <i>Informe sobre los retratos de Cristóbal Colon</i>, printed by the Royal Academy of History
at Madrid, in 1851, in their <i>Memorias</i>, vol. viii.; and by an article, by Isidore Löwenstern, of the Academy of
Sciences at Turin, in the <i>Revue Archéologique</i>, x. 181. The paper by Jomard was the incentive of Carderera.
both treatises induced the review of Löwenstern; while Feuillet de Conches fairly summed up the results.
There has been no thorough account in English. A brief letter on the subject by Irving (printed in the <i>Life of
Irving</i>, vol. iv.) was all there was till Professor J. D. Butler recently traced the pedigree of the Yanez
picture, a copy of which was lately given by Governor Fairchild to the Historical Society of Wisconsin.
Cf. Butler’s paper in the <i>Collections</i> of that Society, vol. ix. p. 76 (also printed separately); and articles in
<i>Lippincott’s Magazine</i>, March, 1883, and <i>The Nation</i>, Nov. 16, 1882.</p>

The vignette is given in colored fac-simile in Major’s <i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>, 2d edition. Herrera’s
picture was reproduced in the English translation by Stevens, and has been accepted in so late a publication as
Gay’s <i>Popular History of the United States</i>, i. 99. Cf. also the portrait in the 1727-1730 edition of Herrera,

Cf. <i>Boletin de la Sociedad geográfica de Madrid</i>, vol. vi. A portrait in the collection of the Marquis de
Malpica is said closely to resemble it. One belonging to the Duke of Veraguas is also thought to be related to
it, and is engraved in the French edition of Navarrete. It is thought Antonio del Rincon, a painter well
known in Columbus’ day, may have painted this Yanez canvas, on the discoverer’s return from his second
voyage. Carderera believed in it, and Banchero, in his edition of the <i>Codice Colombo Americano</i>, adopted it
(<i>Magazine of American History</i>, i. 511). The picture now in the Wisconsin Historical Society’s Rooms is
copied directly from the Yanez portrait.</p>

This Capriolo cut is engraved and accepted in Carderera’s <i>Informe</i>. Löwenstern fails to see how it corresponds
to the written descriptions of Columbus’ person. It is changed somewhat from the 1575 cut; cf. <i>Magasin
pittoresque</i>, troisième année, p. 316. The two cuts, one or the other, and a mingling of the two, have
given rise apparently to a variety of imitations. The head on panel preserved now, or lately, at Cuccaro, and
belonging to Fidele Guglielmo Colombo, is of this type. It was engraved in Napione’s <i>Della patria di Colombo</i>,
Florence, 1808. The head by Crispin de Pas, in the <i>Effigies regum ac principum</i>, of an early year in
the seventeenth century, is also traced to these cuts, as well as the engraving by Pieter van Opmeer in his <i>Opus
chronographicum</i>, 1611. Landon’s <i>Galerie historique</i> (Paris, 1805-1809), also shows an imitation; and
another is that on the title of Cancellieri’s <i>Notizia di Colombo</i>. Navarrete published a lithograph of the 1575
cut. Cf. Irving’s letter. A likeness of this type is reproduced in colors, in a very pleasing way, in Roselly de
Lorgues’ <i>Christophe Colomb</i>, 1879, and in woodcut, equally well done, in the same work; also in J. J. Barry’s
adaptation of De Lorgues, New York, 1869. Another good woodcut of it is given in <i>Harpers’ Monthly</i>
(October, 1882), p. 729. It is also accepted in Torre’s <i>Scritti di Colombo</i>.</p>

There are two portraits thought to have some relation with this Florentine likeness. One was formerly
in the Collection d’Ambras, in the Tyrol, which was formed by a nephew of Charles V., but was in 1805 removed
to the museum in Vienna. It is on panel, of small size, and has been engraved in Frankl’s German poem on
Columbus. The other is one whose history Isnardi, in his <i>Sulla patria di Colombo</i>, 1838, traces back for three
centuries. It is now, or was lately, in the common council hall at Cogoleto.</p>

Engravings from De Bry’s burin also appeared, in 1597, in Boissard’s <i>Icones quinquaginta virorum
ad vivum effictæ</i>; again, in the <i>Bibliotheca sive thesaurus virtutis et gloriæ</i> (Frankfort, 1628-1634),
in four volumes, usually ascribed jointly to De Bry and Boissard; and, finally, in the <i>Bibliotheca
chalcographica</i> (Frankfort, 1650-1664), ascribed to Boissard; but the plates are marked Jean Théodore
de Bry. The De Bry type was apparent in the print in Isaac Bullart’s <i>Académie des Sciences et des Arts</i>,
Paris, 1682; and a few years later (1688), an aquaforte engraving by Rosaspina came out in Paul Freherus’
<i>Théâtre des hommes célèbres</i>. For the later use made of this De Bry likeness, reference may be made, among
others, to the works of Napione and Bossi, Durazzo’s <i>Eulogium</i>, the <i>Historia de Mexico</i> by Francisco Carbajal
Espinosa, published at Mexico, in 1862, tome i, J. J. Smith’s <i>American Historical and Literary Curiosities</i>,
sundry editions of Irving’s <i>Life of Columbus</i>, and the London (1867) edition of Ferdinand Columbus’ Life of
his father. There is a photograph of it in Harrisse’s <i>Notes on Columbus</i>. De Bry engraved various other
pictures of Columbus, mostly of small size,&mdash;a full-length in the corner of a half-globe (part vi.); a full-length
on the deck of a caravel (in part iv., re-engraved in Bossi, Charton, etc.); a small vignette portrait,
together with one of Vespucius, in the Latin and German edition of part iv. (1594); the well-known picture
illustrating the anecdote of the egg (part iv.). Not one of these has any claim to be other than imaginative.
His larger likeness he reproduced in a small medallion as the title of the Herrera narrative (part xii., German

the apocryphal egg story is found in a painting, representing a man in a fur cap, holding up an egg, the face
wearing a grin, which was brought forward a few years ago by Mr. Rinck, of New York, and which is described
and engraved in the <i>Compte rendu</i> of the Congrès des Américanistes, 1877, ii. 375.</p>

<i>Ticknor Catalogue</i>, p. 95. The medallion on the tomb in the cathedral at Havana is usually said to
have been copied from this picture; but the picture sent to Havana to be used as a model is said, on better
authority, to have been one belonging to the Duke of Veraguas,&mdash;perhaps the one said to be in the Consistorial
Hall at Havana, which has the garb of a familiar of the Inquisition; and this is represented as the gift
of that Duke (<i>Magazine of American History</i>, i. 510).</p>

It is re-engraved in the English and German translations. Carderera rejects it; but the portrait in
the Archives of the Indies at Seville is said to be a copy of it; and a copy is in the Pennsylvania Academy
of Arts in Philadelphia. A three-quarters length of Columbus, representing him in ruff and armor, full
face, mustache and imperial, right hand on a globe, left hand holding a truncheon, called “Cristoval Colon:
copiado de un Quadro origl. que se conserva en la familia,” was engraved, and marked “Bart. Vazque. la

Such are the following: (1) In full dress, with ruff and rings, said to have been painted by Sir Anthony
More for Margaret of the Netherlands, and taken to England in 1590,&mdash;engraved in one of the English
editions of Irving, where also has appeared an engraving of a picture by Juan de Borgoña, painted in 1519
for the Chapter-room of the Cathedral of Toledo. (2) A full-length in mail, with ruff, in the Longa or
Exchange at Seville, showing a man of thirty or thirty-five years, which Irving thinks may have been taken
for Diego Columbus. (3) An engraving in Fuchsius’ <i>Metoposcopia et ophthalmoscopia</i>, Strasburg, 1610
(Sabin’s <i>Dictionary</i>, vii. 89). (4) An engraving in N. De Clerck’s <i>Tooneel der beroemder hertogen</i>, etc.,
Delft, 1615,&mdash;a collection of portraits, including also Cortes, Pizarro, Magellan, Montezuma, etc. (5) A
full-length, engraved in Philoponus, 1621. (6) An old engraving, with pointed beard and ruff, preserved
in the National Library at Paris. (7) The engraving in the <i>Nieuwe en onbekende Weereld</i> of Montanus,
1671-1673, repeated in Ogilby’s <i>America</i>, and reproduced in Bos’s <i>Leven en Daden</i>, and in Herrera, edition
1728. A fac-simile of it is given herewith. Cf. Ruyter’s <i>See-Helden</i>, Nuremberg, 1661. (8) A copper
plate, showing a man with a beard, with fur trimmings to a close-fitting vestment, one hand holding an
astrolabe, the other pointing upward,&mdash;which accompanies a translation of Thevet’s account of Columbus
in the appendix to the Cambridge, 1676, edition of North’s <i>Plutarch</i>. (9) An old woodcut in the <i>Neueröffnetes
Amphitheatrum</i>, published at Erfurt in 1723-1724 (<i>Brinley Catalogue</i>, no. 48). (10) A man with
curly hair, mustache and imperial, ruff and armor, with a finger on a globe,&mdash;engraved in Cristóbal Cladera’s
<i>Investigaciones históricas, sobre los principales descubrimientos de los Españoles en el mar Oceano en el
siglo XV. y principios del XVI.</i>, Madrid, 1794. (11) Columbus and his sons, Diego and Ferdinand, engraved
in Bryan Edwards’ <i>The History, civil and commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies</i>, 1794;
again, 1801. Feuillet de Conches in his essay on the portraits calls it a pure fantasy.</p>

The Bishop, in his subsequent <i>Los restos de Colon</i> (Santo Domingo, 1879), written after his honesty in the
matter was impugned, and with the aim of giving a full exposition, shows, in cap. xviii. how the discovery, as
he claimed it, interested the world. Various contemporaneous documents are also given in <i>Colon en Quisqueya,
Coleccion de documentos</i>, etc., Santo Domingo, 1877. A movement was made to erect a monument in Santo
Domingo, and some response was received from the United States. <i>New Jersey Historical Society’s Proceedings</i>,

This was a view advanced by J. I. de Armas in a Caracas newspaper, later set forth in his <i>Las cenizas
de Cristóbal Colon suplantadas en la Catedral de Santo Domingo</i>, Caracas, 1881. The same view is taken by
Sir Travers Twiss, in his <i>Christopher Columbus: A Monograph on his True Burial-place</i> (London, 1879), a paper
which originally appeared in the <i>Nautical Magazine</i>. M. A. Baguet, in “Où sont ces restes de Colomb?”
printed in the <i>Bulletin de la Société d’Anvers</i> (1882), vi. 449, also holds that the remains are those of the
grandson, Cristoval Colon. For an adverse view, see the <i>Informe</i> of the Amigos del Pais, published at Santo
Domingo, 1882. Cf. also Juan Maria Asensio, <i>Los restos de Colon</i>, segunda ed., Sevile, 1881.</p>

said that the certificate of Columbus’ marriage has been discovered in Corsica. Cf. Margry, <i>Navigations

the act of the French President of Aug. 6, 1883, approving of the erection of a monument to Columbus in that
town, have been since reviewed by Harrisse in the <i>Revue critique</i> (18 Juin, 1883), who repeats the arguments
for a belief in Genoa as the birthplace, in a paper, “Christophe Colomb et la Corse,” which has since been
printed separately.</p>

The claims of Savona have been urged the most persistently. The Admiral’s father, it seems to be
admitted, removed to Savona before 1469, and lived there some time; and it is found that members of the
Colombo family, even a Cristoforo Colombo, is found there in 1472; but it is at the same time claimed that this
Cristoforo signed himself as of Genoa. The chief advocate is Belloro, in the <i>Corres. Astron. Géograph. du
Baron de Zach</i>, vol. xi., whose argument is epitomized by Irving, app. v. Cf. Giovanni Tommaso Belloro,
<i>Notizie d’atti esistenti nel publico archivio de’ notaj di Savona, concernenti la famiglia di Cristoforo
Colombo</i>, Torino, 1810, reprinted by Spotorno at Genoa in 1821. Sabin (vol. ii. no. 4,565), corrects errors
of Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, p. 68. Other claims for these Genoese towns are brought forward, for which
see Harrisse, <i>Notes on Columbus</i>; J. R. Bartlett, in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, February, 1868, p. 100; Felice
Isnardi’s <i>Dissertazione</i>, 1838, and <i>Nuovi documenti</i>, 1840, etc. Caleb Cushing in his <i>Reminiscences of Spain</i>,

and gathers all that he can of the Colombos; and it does not seem probable that the Admiral bore anything more
than a very remote relationship to the family of the famous mariners. Major (<i>Select Letters</i>, p. xliii) has also
examined the alleged connection with the French sea-leader, Caseneuve, or Colon. Cf. Desimoni’s <i>Rassegna

Cf. notes on p. 661, <i>et seq.</i>, in Bunbury’s <i>History
of Ancient Geography</i>, vol. i., on the ancients’
calculations of latitude and measurements for
longitude. Ptolemy carried the most northern
parts of the known world sixty-three degrees
north, and the most southern parts sixteen degrees
south, of the Equator, an extent north and
south of seventy-nine degrees. Marinus of Tyre,
who preceded Ptolemy, stretched the known
world, north and south, over eighty-seven degrees.
Marinus had also made the length of the known
world 225 degrees east and west, while Ptolemy
reduced it to 177 degrees; but he did not, nor did
Marinus, bound it definitely in the east by an
ocean, but he left its limit in that direction undetermined,
as he did that of Africa in the south,
which resulted in making the Indian Ocean in his
conception an inland sea, with the possibility of
passing by land from Southern Africa to Southern
Asia, along a parallel. Marinus had been
the first to place the Fortunate Islands farther
west than the limits of Spain in that direction,
though he put them only two and a half degrees
beyond, while the meridian of Ferro is nine
degrees from the most westerly part of the main.</p>

There was a tendency in the latter part of
the sixteenth century to remove the prime
meridian to St. Michael’s, in the Azores, for the
reason that there was no variation in the needle
there at that time, and in ignorance of the
forces which to-day at St. Michael’s make it
point twenty-five degrees off the true north. As
late as 1634 a congress of European mathematicians
confirmed it at the west edge of the Isle de
Fer (Ferro), the most westerly of the Canaries.</p>

These were the calculations of Regiomontanus
(Müller), who calls himself “Monteregius”
in his <i>Tabulæ astronomice Alfonsi regis</i>,
published at Venice in the very year (1492) of
Columbus’ first voyage. (Stevens, <i>Bibl. Geog.</i>,
no. 83.) At a later day the Portuguese accused
the Spaniards of altering the tables then in use,
so as to affect the position of the Papal line of
Demarcation. Barras, quoted by Humboldt,
<i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. tr. ii. 671.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Johann Stoeffler was a leading authority on
the methods of defining latitude and longitude
in vogue in the beginning of the new era; cf.
his <i>Elucidatio fabricæ ususque astrolabii</i>, Oppenheim,
1513 (colophon 1512), and his edition of
<i>In Procli Diadochi sphæram omnibus numeris

contemporary and earlier writers on the subject.

The polar distance of the North Star in

<i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. tr., ii. 658. Humboldt also
points out how Columbus on his second voyage
had attempted to fix his longitude by the declination
of the needle (Ibid., ii. 657; v. 54). Cf.
a paper on Columbus and Cabot in the <i>Nautical
Magazine</i>, July, 1876.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is a fact that good luck or skill of some undiscernible
sort enabled Cabot to record some
remarkable approximations of longitude in an
age when the wildest chance governed like attempts
in others. Cabot indeed had the navigator’s
instinct; and the modern log-book seems
to have owed its origin to his practices and the
urgency with which he impressed the importance
of it upon the Muscovy Company.</p>

Appendix xix. of the <i>Report of the United
States Coast Survey</i> for 1880 (Washington, 1882)
is a paper by Charles A. Schott of “Inquiry
into the Variation of the Compass off the Bahama
Islands, at the time of the Landfall of
Columbus in 1492,” which is accompanied by a
chart, showing by comparison the lines of non-variation
respectively in 1492, 1600, 1700, 1800,
and 1880, as far as they can be made out from
available data. In this chart the line of 1492
runs through the Azores,&mdash;bending east as it
proceeds northerly, and west in its southerly
extension. The no-variation line in 1882 leaves
the South American coast between the mouths
of the Amazon and the Orinoco, and strikes the
Carolina coast not far from Charleston. The
Azores to-day are in the curve of 25° W. variation,
which line leaves the west coast of Ireland,
and after running through the Azores

Charts of the magnetic curves now made
by the Coast Survey at Washington are capable
of supplying, if other means fail, and particularly
in connection with the dipping-needle, data
of a ship’s longitude with but inconsiderable
error. The inclination or dip was not measured
till 1576; and Humboldt shows how under
some conditions it can be used also to determine
latitude.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In 1714 the English Government, following
an example earlier set by other governments,
offered a reward of £20,000 to any one who
would determine longitude at sea within half a
degree. It was ultimately given to Harrison,
a watchmaker who made an improved marine
chronometer. An additional £3,000 was given
at the same time to the widow of Tobias Meyer,
who had improved the lunar tables. It also
instigated two ingenious mechanicians, who hit
upon the same principle independently, and
worked out its practical application,&mdash;the Philadelphian,
Thomas Godfrey, in his “mariner’s
bow” (<i>Penn. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i. 422); and the
Englishman, Hadley, in his well-known quadrant.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It can hardly be claimed to-day, with all our
modern appliances, that a ship’s longitude can
be ascertained with anything more than approximate
precision. The results from dead-reckoning
are to be corrected in three ways. Observations
on the moon will not avoid, except by
accident, errors which may amount to seven or
eight miles. The difficulties of making note of
Jupiter’s satellites in their eclipse, under the
most favorable conditions, will be sure to entail
an error of a half, or even a whole, minute.
This method, first tried effectively about 1700,
was the earliest substantial progress which had
been made; all the attempts of observation on
the opposition of planets, the occultations of
stars, the difference of altitude between the
moon and Jupiter, and the changes in the moon’s
declination, having failed of satisfactory results
(Humboldt, <i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. tr., ii. 671). John
Werner, of Nuremberg, as early as 1514, and
Gemma Frisius, in 1545, had suggested the measure
of the angle between the altitude of the
moon and some other heavenly body; but it was
not till 1615 that it received a trial at sea, through
the assiduity of Baffin. The newer method of
Jupiter’s satellites proved of great value in the
hands of Delisle, the real founder of modern
geographical science. By it he cut off three
hundred leagues from the length of the Mediterranean
Sea, and carried Paris two and a half
degrees, and Constantinople ten degrees, farther
west. Corrections for two centuries had been
chiefly made in a similar removal of places.
For instance, the longitude of Gibraltar had
increased from 7° 50´ W., as Ptolemy handed it
down, to 9° 30´ under Ruscelli, to 13° 30´ under
Mercator, and to 14° 30´ under Ortelius. It is
noticeable that Eratosthenes, who two hundred
years and more before Christ was the librarian
at Alexandria and chief of its geographical
school, though he made the length of the Mediterranean
six hundred geographical miles too
long, did better than Ptolemy three centuries
later, and better even than moderns had done
up to 1668, when this sea was elongated by
nearly a third beyond its proper length. Cf.
Bunbury, <i>History of Ancient Geography</i>, i. 635;
Gosselin, <i>Géog. des Grecs</i>, p. 42. Sanson was
the last, in 1668, to make this great error.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The method for discovering longitude which
modern experience has settled upon is the noting
at noon, when the weather permits a view
of the sun, of the difference of a chronometer
set to a known meridian. This instrument, with
all its modern perfection, is liable to an error of
ten or fifteen seconds in crossing the Atlantic,
which may be largely corrected by a mean,
derived from the use of more than one chronometer.
The first proposition to convey time
as a means of deciding longitude dates back to
Alonzo de Santa Cruz, who had no better time-keepers
than sand and water clocks (Humboldt,
<i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. tr., ii. 672).</p>
<p class="pfc4">On land, care and favorable circumstances
may now place an object within six or eight
yards of its absolute place in relation to the
meridian. Since the laying of the Atlantic
cable has made it possible to use for a test a
current which circles the earth in three seconds,
it is significant of minute accuracy, in fixing the
difference of time between Washington and
Greenwich, that in the three several attempts to
apply the cable current, the difference between
the results has been less than <span class="small"><sup>7</sup></span>/<span class="small"><sub>100</sub></span> of a second.</p>
<p class="pfc4">But on shipboard the variation is still great,
though the last fifty years has largely reduced
the error. Professor Rogers, of the Harvard
College Observatory, in examining one hundred
log-books of Atlantic steamships, has found an
average error of three miles; and he reports as
significant of the superior care of the Cunard
commanders that the error in the logs of their
ships was reduced to an average of a mile and
a half.</p>

Strabo, i. 65. Bunbury, <i>Ancient Geography</i>,
i. 627, says the passage is unfortunately mutilated,
but the words preserved can clearly have
no other signification. What is left to us of
Eratosthenes are fragments, which were edited
by Seidel, at Göttingen, in 1789; again and
better by Bernhardy (Berlin, 1822). Bunbury
(vol. i. ch. xvi.) gives a sufficient survey of his
work and opinions. The spherical shape of the
earth was so generally accepted by the learned
after the times of Aristotle and Euclid, that
when Eratosthenes in the third century, B.C.
went to some length to prove it, Strabo, who
criticised him two centuries later, thought he
had needlessly exerted himself to make plain
what nobody disputed. Eratosthenes was so
nearly accurate in his supposed size of the globe,
that his excess over the actual size was less than
one-seventh of its great circle.</p>

There is a manuscript map of Hispaniola
attached to the copy of the 1511 edition of
Peter Martyr in the Colombina Library which is
sometimes ascribed to Columbus; but Harrisse
thinks it rather the work of his brother Bartholomew
(<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, <i>Add.</i>, xiii.) A map of
this island, with the native divisions as Columbus
found them, is given in Muñoz. The earliest
separate map is in the combined edition of
Peter Martyr and Oviedo edited by Ramusio
in Venice in 1534 (Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca geographica</i>,
no. 1,778). <i>Le discours de la navigation
de Jean et Raoul Parmentier, de Dieppe</i>, including
a description of Santo Domingo, was edited by
Ch. Schefer in Paris, 1883; a description of
the “isle de Haity” from <i>Le grand insulaire

Of La Cosa, who is said to have been of
Basque origin, we know but little. Peter Martyr
tells us that his “cardes” were esteemed, and
mentions finding a map of his in 1514 in Bishop
Fonseca’s study. We know he was with Columbus
in his expedition along the southern coast
of Cuba, when the Admiral, in his folly, made
his companions sign the declaration that they
were on the coast of Asia. This was during
Columbus’ second voyage, in 1494; and Stevens
(<i>Notes</i>, etc.) claims that the way in which La
Cosa cuts off Cuba to the west with a line of
green paint&mdash;the conventional color for “terra
incognita”&mdash;indicates this possibility of connection
with the main, as Ruysch’s scroll does in
his map. The interpretation may be correct;
but it might still have been drawn an island
from intimations of the natives, though Ocampo
did not circumnavigate it till 1508. The natives
of Guanahani distinctly told Columbus that Cuba
was an island, as he relates in his Journal. Stevens
also remarks how La Cosa colors, with the
same green, the extension of Cuba beyond the
limits of Columbus’ exploration on the north
coast in 1492. La Cosa, who had been with
Ojeda in 1499, and with Rodrigo de Bastidas in
1501, was killed on the coast in 1509. Cf. Enrique
de Leguina’s <i>Juan de la Cosa, estudio biográfico</i>
(Madrid, 1877); Humboldt’s <i>Examen critique</i>

of an illiterate seaman.” There is also a reproduction
of the American parts of the map in

Printed for the first time in Harrisse, <i>Les
Cortereal</i>, app. xvii. From Pasqualigo and
Cantino down to the time of Gomara we find no
mention of these events; and Gomara, writing
fifty years later, seems to confound the events
of 1500 with those of 1501. Gomara also seems
to have had some Portuguese charts, which we
do not now know, when he says that Cortereal
gave his name to some islands in the entrance
of the gulf “Cuadrado” (St. Lawrence?), lying
under 50° north latitude. Further than this,
Gomara, as well as Ramusio, seems to have
depended mainly on the Pasqualigo letter; and
Herrera followed Gomara (Harrisse, <i>Les Cortereal</i>,
p. 59). Harrisse can now collate, as he does
(p. 65), the two narratives of Pasqualigo and
Cantino for the first time, and finds Cortereal’s
explorations to have covered the Atlantic coast
from Delaware Bay to Baffin’s Bay, if not farther
to the north.</p>

Some have considered that this Atlantic
coast in Cantino may in reality have been Yucatan.
But this peninsula was not visited earlier
than 1506, if we suppose Solis and Pinzon
reached it, and not earlier than 1517 if Cordova’s
expedition was, as is usually supposed,
the first exploration. The names on this coast,
twenty-two in number, are all legible but six.
They resemble those on the Ptolemy maps of
1508 and 1513, and on Schöner’s globe of
1520, which points to an earlier map not now
known.</p>

The editions of 1516 and 1530 have no
map, and no <i>official</i> map was published in Spain
till 1790. The Cabot map of 1544 is clearly
from Spanish sources, and Brevoort is inclined
to think that the single copy known is the
remainder after a like suppression. The Medina
sketch of 1545 is too minute to have conveyed
much intelligence of the Spanish knowledge,
and may have been permitted.</p>

The Admiral could hardly have been other

Pope Julius II. (July 28, 1506) gave to
Tosinus, the publisher, the exclusive sale of this
edition for six years. It was first issued in
1507, and had six new maps, besides those of the
editions of 1478 and 1490, but none of America.
There are copies in the Carter-Brown Library;
and noted in the <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, no. 2,049;
and one was recently priced by Rosenthal, of
Munich, at 500 marks. It was reissued in 1508,
with a description of the New World by Beneventanus,
accompanied by this map of Ruysch;
and of this 1508 edition there are copies in
the Astor Library, the Library of Congress,
of the American Geographical Society, of Yale
College (Cooke sale, vol. ii. no. 1,949), and in
the Carter-Brown and Kalbfleisch collections.
One is noted in the Murphy sale, no. 2,050,
which is now at Cornell University.</p>

The bibliography of Honter has
been traced by G. D. Teutsch in the
<i>Archiv des Vereins für Siebenbürgische
Landeskunde</i>, neue Folge, xiii. 137; and
an estimate of Honter by F. Teutsch
is given in Ibid., xv. 586. The earliest form of
Honter’s book is the <i>Rudimentorum cosmographiæ
libri duo</i>, dated 1531, and published at Cracow,
in a tract of thirty-two pages. It is a description
of the world in verse, and touches America in the
chapter, “Nomina insularum oceani et maris.”
It is extremely rare, and the only copy to be
noted is one priced by Harrassowitz (<i>Catalogue</i>
of 1876, no. 2), of Leipsic, for 225 marks, and
subsequently sold to Tross, of Paris. Most bibliographers
give Cracow, with the date 1534 as
the earliest (Sabin, no. 32,792; Muller, 1877,
no. 1,456,&mdash;37.50 fl.); there was a Basle edition
of the same year. (Cf. Harrisse, <i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 194; Wieser, <i>Magalhâes-Strasse</i>,
p. 22.) Editions seem to have followed in 1540
(queried by Sabin, no. 32,793); in 1542 (if Stevens’s
designation of his fac-simile of the map is
correct, <i>Notes</i>, pl. 3); in 1546, when the map is
inscribed “Universalis cosmographia ... Tiguri,
J. H. V. E. [in monogram], 1546.” (Harrisse,
no. 271; Muller, 1877, no. 1,457; Carter-Brown,
no. 143; Sabin, no. 32,794.) The same map,
which is part of an appendix of thirteen maps,
was repeated in the Tiguri edition of 1548, and
there was another issue the same year at Basle.
(Harrisse, no. 287; Sabin, no. 32,795; Weigel,
1877, no. 1,268.) The maps were repeated in the
1549 edition. (Sabin, no. 32,796; Carter-Brown,
no. 153.) The edition at Antwerp in 1552 leaves
off the date. (Harrisse, no. 287; Weigel, no.
1,269; Murphy, no. 1,252.) It is now called,
<i>Rvdimentorvm cosmographicorum libri III. cum
tabellis geographicis elegantissimis. De uariarum
rerum nomenclaturis per classes, liber I</i>. There
was a Basle edition the same year. The maps
continued to be used in the Antwerp edition of
1554, the Tiguri of 1558, and the Antwerp of
1660.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In 1561 the edition published at Basle, <i>De
cosmogaphiæ rudimentis libri VIII.</i>, was rather
tardily furnished with new maps better corresponding
to the developments of American geography.
(Muller, 1877, no. 1,459.) The Tiguri
publishers still, however, adhered to the old
plates in their editions of 1565 (Carter-Brown,
no. 257; Sabin, no. 32,797); and the same plates
again reappeared in an edition, without place,
published in 1570 (Muller, 1877, no. 1,457), in
another of Tiguri in 1583, and in still another
without place in 1590 (Murphy, no. 1,253; Muller,
1872, no. 763; Sabin, no. 32,799).</p>

This Strasburg edition is particularly described
in D’Avezac’s <i>Waltzemüller</i>, p. 159.
(Cf. Harrisse’s <i>Notes on Columbus</i>, 176; his <i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 117; and Winsor’s <i>Bibliography of
Ptolemy’s Geography</i> sub anno 1522.) The maps
closely resemble those of Waldseemüller in the
edition of 1513; and indeed Frisius assigns them
as re-engraved to Martin Ilacomylus, the Greek
form of that geographer’s name. There are
copies of this 1522 Ptolemy in the Harvard College,
Carter-Brown, Cornell University, and Barlow
libraries, and one is noted in the <i>Murphy
Catalogue</i>, no. 2,054, which is now in the Lenox
Library. The map of Frisius (Lorenz Friess, as
he was called in unlatinized form) was reproduced
in the next Strasburg edition of 1525, of
which there are copies in the Library of Congress,
in the New York Historical Society, Boston
Public, Baltimore Mercantile, Carter-Brown,
Trinity College, and the American Antiquarian
Society libraries, and in the collections of William
C. Prime and Charles H. Kalbfleisch.
There were two copies in the Murphy sale,
nos. 2,055 and 2,056, one of which is now at
Cornell University. Cf. references in Winsor’s
<i>Bibliography of Ptolemy</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">This “L. F. 1522” map (see p. 175), as well as
the “Admiral’s map,” was reproduced in the edition
of 1535, edited by Servetus, of which there
are copies in the Astor, the Boston Public, and
the College of New Jersey libraries, and in the
Carter-Brown and Barlow collections. A copy
is also noted in the <i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, no. 2,057,
which is now at Cornell University.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The American maps of these editions were
again reproduced in the Ptolemy, published at
Vienna in 1541, of which there are copies in the
Carter-Brown, Brevoort, and Kalbfleisch collections.

Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>) gives the various
ways of spelling the name by different authors
as follows: “Albericus (<i>Madrignano</i>, <i>Ruchamer</i>,
<i>Jehan Lambert</i>); Emeric (<i>Du Redouer</i>); Alberico
or Americo (<i>Gomara</i>); Morigo (<i>Hojeda</i>);
Amerrigo (<i>Muñoz</i>); Americus (<i>Peter Martyr</i>);
Almerigo Florentino (<i>Vianello</i>); De Espuche,
Vespuche, Despuche, Vespuccio (<i>Ramusio</i>);
Vespuchy (<i>Christ. Columbus</i>).” Varnhagen uniformly
calls him Amerigo Vespucci; and that
is the signature to the letter written from Spain
in 1492 given in the <i>Vita</i> by Bandini.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_449_449" id="Footnote_449_449"></a><a href="#FNanchor_449_449"><span class="label">[449]</span></a></span>
The facts relative to the birth, parentage,
and early life of Vespucci are given by the Abbé
Bandini in his <i>Vita e lettere di Amerigo Vespucci</i>,
1745, and are generally accepted by those whose
own researches have been most thorough,&mdash;as
Humboldt in his <i>Examen Critique</i>; Varnhagen
in his <i>Amerigo Vespucci, son caractère, ses écrits,
sa vie, et ses navigations</i>, and in his <i>Nouvelles
recherches</i>, p. 41, where he reprints Bandini’s
account; and Santarem in his <i>Researches respecting
Americus Vespucius and his Voyages</i>, as the
English translation is called. In relation to representatives
of the family in our day, see Lester’s
<i>Vespucius</i>, p. 405. The newspapers within a year
have said that two female descendants were
living in Rome, the last male representative
dying seven years ago.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_450_450" id="Footnote_450_450"></a><a href="#FNanchor_450_450"><span class="label">[450]</span></a></span>
Humboldt says that it cannot be true of
either voyage, and relies for proof upon the
documentary evidence of Vespucci’s presence
in Spain during the absence of Columbus upon
those expeditions. But he makes a curious mistake
in regard to the first, which, we think, has
never been noticed. Columbus sailed on his
first voyage in August, 1492, and returned in
March, 1493. Humboldt asserts that Vespucci
could not have been with him, because the letter
written from Cadiz and jointly signed by him
and Donato Nicolini was dated Jan. 30, 1493.
But Humboldt has unaccountably mistaken the
date of that letter; it was not 1493, but 1492,
seven months before Columbus sailed on his
first voyage. The <i>alibi</i>, therefore, is not proved.
There is indeed no positive proof that Vespucci
was not on that voyage; but, on the other hand,
there is nothing known of that period of his
life to suggest that he was; and, moreover, the
strong negative evidence is&mdash;unusually strong
in his case&mdash;that he never claimed to have
sailed with Columbus.</p>

The very name he bore had a divine significance,
according to the fanciful interpretation
of his son, Don Ferdinand Colon. For
as the name Christopher, or Christophorus,&mdash;the
Christ-bearer,&mdash;was bestowed upon the
Saint who carried the Christ over deep waters at
his own great peril, so had it fallen upon him,
who was destined to discover a new world,
“that those Indian nations might become citizens
and inhabitants of the Church triumphant in
heaven.” Nor less appropriate was the family
name of Columbus, or Colomba,&mdash;a dove,&mdash;for
him who showed “those people, who knew him
not, which was God’s beloved Son, as the Holy
Ghost did in the figure of a dove at Saint John’s
baptism; and because he also carried the olive-branch
and oil of baptism over the waters of
the ocean like Noah’s dove, to denote the peace
and union of these people with the Church,
after they had been shut up in the ark of darkness
and confusion.” Saint Christopher carrying
Christ, appears as a vignette on Cosa’s chart.</p>

Amulrich, was spread through Europe by the

[After a picture in the Massachusetts Historical
Society’s Gallery (no. 253), which is a
copy of the best-known portrait of Vespucius.
It is claimed for it that it was painted from life
by Bronzino, and that it had been preserved in
the family of Vespucius till it was committed, in
1845, to Charles Edwards Lester, United States
consul at Genoa. It is engraved in Lester and
Foster’s <i>Life and Voyages of Americus Vespucius</i>
(New York, 1846), and described on p. 414 of
that book. Cf. also Sparks’s statement in <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, iv. 117. It has been also engraved
in Canovai among the Italian authorities,
and was first, I think, in this country, produced
in Philadelphia, in 1815, in Delaplaine’s <i>Repository
of the Lives and Portraits of distinguished
American characters</i>, and later in various other
places. The likeness of Vespucius in the Royal
Gallery at Naples, painted by Parmigianino, is
supposed to be the one originally in the possession
of the Cardinal Alexander Farnese (<i>Bulletin
de la Société de Géographie de Paris</i>, iii. 370, by
Jomard). That artist was but eleven years old
at the death of Vespucius, and could not have
painted Vespucius from life. A copy in 1853
was placed in the gallery of the American Antiquarian
Society (<i>Proceedings</i>, April, 1853,
p. 15; Paine’s <i>Portraits and Busts</i>, etc., no. 28).
C. W. Peale’s copy of the likeness in the gallery
of the Grand Duke of Tuscany is in the
collection belonging to the Pennsylvania Historical
Society (<i>Catalogue</i>, 1872, no. 148). There
is also a portrait in the gallery of the New York
Historical Society (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 131), but the
origin of it is not named. De Bry gives vignette
portraits in parts iv., vi., and xii. of his
<i>Grands Voyages</i>. See Bandini’s <i>Vita e lettere

likenesses.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

[Vespucci himself says that his mission was
“per ajutare a discoprire.” An astronomer was
an important officer of all these early expeditions.
Isabella urged Columbus not to go without
one on his second voyage; and in his narrative
of his fourth voyage, Columbus contends that
there is but one infallible method of making a
ship’s reckoning, that employed by astronomers.

[Varnhagen thinks there is reason to believe,
from the letter of Vianello, that Vespucius made
a voyage in 1505 to the northern coast of South
America, when he tracked the shore from the
point of departure on his second voyage as far
as Darien; and he is further of the opinion, from
passages in the letters of Francesco Corner, that
Vespucius made still a final voyage with La Cosa
to the coast of Darien (<i>Postface</i> in <i>Nouvelles
recherches</i>, p. 56). Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.,
Additions</i>, p. xxvii) gives reasons, from letters
discovered by Rawdon Brown at Venice, for
believing that Vespucius made a voyage in
1508.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.]</p>

It is reprinted in Varnhagen, <i>Amerigo Vespucci</i>, p. 78. The manuscript is not in Vespucius’

went on this voyage, or on that with Coelho in 1503,&mdash;holding that the one with Ojeda and La Cosa
is the only indisputable voyage which Vespucius made (Childe’s translation, p. 145), though, as Navarrete also
admits, he may have been on these or other voyages in a subordinate capacity. Santarem cites Lafitau, Barros,
and Osorius as ignoring any such voyage by Vespucius. Vespucius says he could still see the Great
Bear constellation when at 32° south; but Humboldt points out that it is not visible beyond 26° south
latitude.</p>

Varnhagen is confident (<i>Postface</i> in <i>Nouvelles recherches</i>, p. 56) that Vespucius was aware that he had

<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 30; Carter-Brown, i. 23. A copy was (no. 233) in a sale at Sotheby’s, London,

Trivulziana, and Marciana libraries, is identical with this.</p>

This title is followed on the same page by a large cut of the King of Portugal with sceptre and shield.
The little plaquette has six folios, small quarto (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 33). A fac-simile edition was made by
Pilinski at Paris (twenty-five copies), in 1861. Cf. Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 25, with fac-simile of title; Murphy,
no. 2,616; Huth, v. 1525; O’Callaghan, no. 2,328; Cooke, no. 2,519. There is a copy of this fac-simile,

Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 87) describes it from a copy in the British Museum which is noted in
the <i>Grenville Catalogue</i>, p. 764, no. 6,535. D’Avezac, in 1867, noted, besides the Grenville copy, one belonging
to the Marquis Gino Capponi at Florence, and Varnhagen’s (<i>Waltzemüller</i>, p. 45; Peignot, <i>Répertoire</i>, p. 139;
Heber, vol. vi. no. 3,848; Napione, <i>Del primo scopritore del nuovo mondo</i>, 1809, p. 107; Ebert, <i>Dictionary</i>,
no. 27,542; Ternaux, no. 5). Harrisse in 1872 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, p. xxiv), added a fourth copy,
belonging to the Palatina in Florence (Biblioteca Nazionale), and thinks there may have been formerly a
duplicate in that collection, which Napione describes. The copy described by Peignot may have been the same
with the Heber and Grenville copies; and the Florence copy mentioned by Harrisse in his <i>Ferdinand Colomb</i>,
p. 11, may also be one of those already mentioned. The copy which Brunet later described in his <i>Supplément</i>
passed into the Court Collection (no. 366); and when that splendid library was sold, in 1884, this copy was considered
its gem, and was bought by Quaritch for £524, but is now owned by Mr. Chas. H. Kalbfleisch, of New York.
The copies known to Varnhagen in 1865 were&mdash;one which had belonged to Baccio Valori, used by Bandini; one
which belonged to Gaetano Poggiale, described by Napione; the Grenville copy; and his own, which had
formerly belonged to the Libreria de Nuestra Señora de las Cuevas de la Cartuja in Seville. The same text was
printed in 1745 in Bandini’s <i>Vita e lettere di Amerigo Vespucci</i>, and in 1817 in Canovai’s <i>Viaggi d’Americo
Vespucci</i>, where it is interjected among other matter, voyage by voyage.</p>

There was also a French edition at Antwerp the same year, and it was reprinted in Paris in 1830.
There were editions in Latin at Antwerp in 1556, at Tiguri in 1559, and an Elzevir edition in 1632 (Carter-Brown,

Santarem dismisses the claim that Vespucius was the intimate of either the first or second Duke René.
Cf. Childe’s translation, p. 57, and H. Lepage’s <i>Le Duc René II. et Améric Vespuce</i>, Nancy, 1875. Irving

How Europe, which on a modern map would seem to be but one continent with Asia, became one of
three great continents known to the ancients, is manifest from the world as it was conceived by Eratosthenes
in the third century. In his map the Caspian Sea was a gulf indented from the Northern Ocean, so that only
a small land-connection existed between Asia and Europe, spanned by the Caucasus Mountains, with the
Euxine on the west and the Caspian on the east; just as the isthmus at the head of the Arabian Gulf also
joined Libya, or Africa, to Asia. Cf. Bunbury’s <i>History of Ancient Geography</i>, i. 660.</p>

Humboldt (<i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. tr., ii. 420) particularly instances his descriptions of the coast of Brazil. For
fifteen hundred years, as Humboldt points out (p. 660), naturalists had known no mention, except that of
Adulis, of snow in the tropical regions, when Vespucius in 1500 saw the snowy mountains of Santa Marta.
Humboldt (again in his <i>Cosmos</i>, Eng. tr., ii. 664, 667), according Vespucius higher literary acquirements than the
other early navigators had possessed, speaks of his extolling not ungracefully the glowing richness of the light
and picturesque grouping and strange aspect of the constellations that circle the Southern Pole, which is surrounded
by so few stars,&mdash;and tells how effectively he quoted Dante at the sight of the four stars, which were
not yet for several years to be called the Southern Cross. Irving speaks of Vespucius’ narrative as “spirited.”</p>

This Latin text of Bassin was also printed at Venice in 1537 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 156;
Leclerc, no. 2,517). Humboldt (<i>Examen critique</i>, iv. 102, 114) and others have been misled by a similarity of
title in supposing that there were other editions of the <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i> published at Ingoldstadt in 1529,
1532, and at Venice in 1535, 1541, 1551, and 1554. This book, however, is only an abridgment of Apian’s
<i>Cosmographia</i>, which was originally printed at Landshut in 1524. Cf. Huth, i. 357; Leclerc, no. 156; D’Avezac,
<i>Waltzemüller</i>, p. 124. The Bassin version of the voyages was later the basis of the accounts, either at length
or abridged, or in versions in other languages, in the <i>Paesi novamente</i> and its translations; in the <i>Novus orbis</i>
of 1532 (it is here given as addressed to René, King of Sicily and Jerusalem), and later, in Ramusio’s <i>Viaggi</i>,
vol. i. (1550); in Eden’s <i>Treatyse of the Newe India</i> (1553); in the <i>Historiale description de l’Afrique</i> of Leo
Africanus (1556),&mdash;cf. <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 211, 229; in De Bry, first and second parts of the
Grands voyages, and third and fourth of the <i>Petits voyages</i>, not to name other of the older collections; and

Harrisse (<i>Fernand Colomb</i>, p. 30), says: “The absence of nautical charts and planispheres, not only
in the Colombina, but in all the muniment offices of Spain, is a signal disappointment. There is one chart
which above all we need,&mdash;made by Vespucius, and which, in 1518, was in the collection of the Infanta
Ferdinand, brother of Charles V.” A copy of Valsequa’s chart of 1439 which belonged to Vespucius, being
marked “Questa ampla pelle di geographia fù pagata da Amerigo Vespucci cxxx ducati di oro di marco,” was,
according to Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet. Add.</i>, p. xxiii), in existence in Majorca as late as 1838.</p>

Sir Thomas More in his <i>Utopia</i> (which it will he remembered was an island on which Vespucius is represented
as leaving one of his companions), as published in the 1551 edition at London, speaks of the general
repute of Vespucius’ account,&mdash;“Those iiii voyages that be nowe in printe and abrode in euery mannes handes.”
Cf. <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, vol. i. no. 162. William Cuningham, in his <i>Cosmographical Glasse</i> (London,

tardy justice to the memory of Columbus by taking his name, in the form of Columbia, as a national designation
of the United States; but it necessarily failed (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ii. 315). “Allegania” was an alternative

Vizconde de Santarem (Manoel Francisco de Barros y Sousa), <i>Researches respecting Americus Vespucius

historiques, critiques et bibliographiques sur Améric Vespuce et ses voyages</i>, which was published in Paris in
1842. Santarem had before this sought to discredit the voyages claimed for Vespucius in 1501 and 1503, and
had communicated a memoir on the subject to Navarrete’s <i>Coleccion</i>. He also published a paper in the <i>Bulletin
de la Société de Géographie de Paris</i> in October, 1833, and added to his statements in subsequent numbers
(October, 1835; September, 1836; February and September, 1837). These various contributions were combined
and annotated in the <i>Recherches</i>, etc., already mentioned. Cf. his <i>Memoria e investigaciones históricas
sobre los viajes de Américo Vespucio</i>, in the <i>Recueil complet de traités</i>, vi. 304. There is a biography of Vespucius,
with an appendix of “Pruebas é ilustraciones” in the <i>Coleccion de Opúsculos</i> of Navarrete, published
(1848) at Madrid, after his death.</p>

His theory was advanced in a paper on “The Origin of the Name America” in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>
(March, 1875), xxxv. 291, and in “Sur l’origine du nom d’Amérique,” in the <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie
de Paris</i>, June, 1875. He again advanced his theory in the <i>New York Nation</i>, April 10, 1884, to which
the editors replied that it was “fatally ingenious,”&mdash;a courteous rejoinder, quite in contrast with that of H. H.
Bancroft in his <i>Central America</i> (i. 291), who charges the Professor with “seeking fame through foolishness”
and his theory. Marcou’s argument in part depends upon the fact, as he claims, that Vespucius’ name was
properly Albericus or Alberico, and he disputes the genuineness of autographs which make it Amerigo; but
nothing was more common in those days than variety, for one cause or another, in the fashioning of names.
We find the Florentine’s name variously written,&mdash;Amerigo, Merigo, Almerico, Alberico, Alberigo; and
Vespucci, Vespucy, Vespuchi, Vespuchy, Vesputio, Vespulsius, Despuchi, Espuchi; or in Latin Vespucius,
Vespuccius, and Vesputius.</p>

Cf. Navarrete, <i>Coleccion</i>, iii. 19, <i>note</i>. Humboldt
(<i>Examen critique</i>, i. 313) says that Vicente
Yañez saw the coast forty-eight days before
Cabral left Lisbon. As to the exact date of
Vicente Yañez’ landfall, the <i>Paesi novamente</i>
(chap. cxii.) gives it as January 20, while Peter
Martyr (dec. i. chap. ix.), who usually follows
the <i>Paesi novamente</i>, in his description of this
and of the Guerra and Niño voyages gives it as
“Septimo kalendas Februarii,” or January 26.
But the difference is unimportant. [Cf. further

of South America,” in which the question is

See also Navarrete, <i>Notice chronologique</i>,
in <i>Quatre voyages</i>, i. 349, and Humboldt, Introduction
to Ghillany’s <i>Behaim</i>, p. 2, where he
says, in the description of the La Cosa map,
that Cabo de S. Augustin, whose position is very
accurately laid down on that map, was first
called Rostro Hermoso, Cabo Sta. Maria de la
Consolacion, and Cabo Sta. Cruz. In this he is
probably correct; for if Vicente Yañez or Lepe
did not discover it, how did La Cosa know
where to place it?&mdash;unless he revised his map
after 1500. This is not likely, as the map contains
no hint of the discoveries made during his
third voyage undertaken with Rodrigo de Bastidas
in 1500-1502. Cf. Stevens, <i>Notes</i>, p. 33,

to Bernal Diaz, <i>Historia verdadera</i>, ed. of 1632,
folio 6; Oviedo, i. 502; Herrera, dec. ii. lib. 31,
chap. i. As to his future career, see Bancroft,

[A copy of this, which belonged to Ferdinand
Columbus, is in the Cathedral Library at
Seville. The book is so scarce that Muñoz used
a manuscript copy; and from Muñoz’ manuscript
the one used by Prescott was copied. Maisonneuve
(1882 <i>Catalogue</i>, no. 2,980) has recently
priced a copy at 600 francs. There is a copy
in the Carter-Brown Library (<i>Catalogue</i>, vol. i.
no. 65), and was sold the present year in the
Court sale (no. 362). It was reprinted in 1522,
1526 (Murphy, no, 2,580), and 1535,&mdash;the last
priced by Maisonneuve (no. 2,981) at 400 francs.
Cf. Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, nos. 98, 114, 137,
205, and <i>Additions</i>, no. 59. The <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i> (i. 119) puts a Venice edition, without
date, under 1536. Ternaux gives a French translation
in his <i>Relations et mémoires</i>, vol. x. Icazbalceta
has given a Spanish version from the
Italian, together with the Italian text, in his <i>Coleccion
de documentos para la historia de México</i>,
i. 281; also see his introduction, p. xv. He
points out the errors of Ternaux’s version. Cf.
Bandelier’s “Bibliography of Yucatan” in
<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i> (October, 1880), p. 82.
Harrisse in his <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>,
no. 60, cites a <i>Lettera mādata della insula de
Cuba</i>, 1520, which he says differs from the
account of Juan Diaz.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Yucatan seems to have been first named,
or its name at least was first recorded, as
Yuncatan by Bartholomew Columbus (<i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i>, p. 471). There are various theories
regarding the origin of the name. Cf. Bancroft,
<i>Mexico</i>, i. 11, 12; Prescott, <i>Mexico</i>, i. 223. A
new Government map of Yucatan was published
in 1878 (<i>Magazine of American History</i>, vol. iii.

Cf. Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, i. 21; Valentini in
<i>Magazine of American History</i>, iii. 295, who
supposes that the land usually thought to be
an incomplete Cuba in Ruysch’s map of 1508
(p. 115, <i>ante</i>) is really Yucatan, based on the results
of the so-called first voyage of Vespucius,
and that its seven Latin names correspond to a
part of the nineteen Portuguese names which
are given on the western shore of the so-called
Admiral’s map of the Ptolemy of 1513 (p. 112,
<i>ante</i>). Peschel (<i>Geschichte der Erdkunde</i>, 1865,
p. 235) also suggests that this map is the work
of Vespucius.</p>

<i>Memoir on a Mappemonde by Leonardo da
Vinci</i> communicated to the Society of Antiquaries
by R. H. Major, who makes its date between
1513 and 1519,&mdash;probably 1514. The <i>Ptolemy</i>
printed at Basle 1552 lays down Terra Florida
and Ins. Tortucarum, and the map in Girava’s
<i>Cosmography</i> shows Florida and Bacalaos; but
the B. de Joan Ponce appears in <i>La geografia
di Clavdio Ptolomeo Alessandrino</i>, Venice, 1548.

Vinci is given on p. 126.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Testimony of Alonzo Despinosa Cervantes
and of Father Antonio de Cervantes, O.S.D., in
1561. The date is clearly fixed after May 26, and
before June 9, as Ayllon testified on the former
day, and on the latter his procurator appeared
for him. Navarrete is wrong in making him sail
about the middle of July (<i>Coleccion</i>, iii. 72).</p>

“Aqui desembarco Panfilo de Narvaez.”
Mappemonde of Sebastian Cabot in Jomard.
This map has always been supposed to be based
on Spanish sources; but owing to the strict prohibition
of publication in Spain, it was probably
printed elsewhere, “in Brussels or Amsterdam,
or some such place,” as Gayangos thinks. It
is seemingly engraved on wood (Smith’s <i>Relation
of Alvar Nuñez Cabeça de Vaca</i>, p. 56); or
at least some have thought so.</p>

of three vessels, bearing one hundred men.
The vessels were scattered in a storm, and ran
to Mexico and Cuba. After that Pedro Menendez,
who was in command of a fleet sailing from

A council held in Mexico of persons who
had been in Florida agreed that the royal order
was based on accurate information (<i>Parecer que

in a brief, manly letter solicited of the King an

deemed deserving of it (<i>Memorial que dió al

Jacques de Sorie, in 1555, at Havana,
after pledging his word to spare the lives of the
Spaniards who surrendered, put them and his
Portuguese prisoners to death; negroes he hung
up and shot while still alive (<i>Relacion de Diego
de Mazauegos, MS.</i>; Letter of Bishop Sarmiento
in <i>Coleccion de documentos inéditos</i>, v. 555).
Priests, especially those of religious Orders,
met no mercy at the hands of the French
cruisers at this period, the most atrocious
case being that of the Portuguese Jesuit
Father Ignatius Azevedo, captured by the
French on his way to Brazil with thirty-nine
missionary companions, all of whom were put
to death, in 1570. In all my reading, I find
no case where the French in Spanish waters
then gave quarter to Spaniards, except in hope
of large ransom. Two of the vessels found at
Caroline were Spanish, loaded with sugar and
hides, captured near Yaguana by the French,
who threw all the crew overboard; and Gourgues,
on reaching Florida, had two barks, evidently
captured from the Spaniards, as to the fate of
whose occupants his eulogists observe a discreet
silence.</p>

This is the Spanish account of Solis de
Meras. Lemoyne, who escaped from Caroline,
gives an account based on the statement of
a Dieppe sailor who made his way to the Indians,
and though taken by the Spaniards, fell at last
into French hands. Challeux, the carpenter
of Caroline, and another account derived from
Christophe le Breton, one of those spared by
Menendez, maintain that Menendez promised
La Caille, under oath and in writing to spare
their lives if they surrendered. This seems
utterly improbable; for Menendez from first to
last held to his original declaration, “<i>el que
fuere herege morira</i>.” Lemoyne is so incorrect
as to make this last slaughter take place at
Caroline.</p>

Barcia, in the <i>Introduccion a el Ensayo
cronológico</i>, pp. 26, 27, discusses the date of
Ponce de Leon’s discovery. He refutes Remesal,
Ayeta, and Moreri, who gave 1510, and
adopts the date 1512 as given by the “safest
historians,” declaring that Ponce de Leon went
to Spain in 1513. The date 1512 was adopted
by Hakluyt, George Bancroft, and Irving; but
after Peschel in his <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der
Entdeckungen</i> called attention to the fact that
Easter Sunday in 1512 did not fall on March 27,
the date given by Herrera, without mentioning
the year, but that it did fall on that day in 1513,
Kohl (<i>Discovery of Maine</i>, p. 240), George
Bancroft, in later editions, and others adopted
1513, without any positive evidence. But 1512
is nevertheless clung to by Gravier in his “Route
du Mississippi” (<i>Congrès des Américanistes</i>, 1878,
i. 238), by Shipp in his <i>De Soto and Florida</i>, and
by H. H. Bancroft in his <i>Central America</i> (vol.
i. p. 128). Mr. Deane, in a note to Hakluyt’s
use of 1512 in the <i>Westerne Planting</i> (p. 230),
says the mistake probably occurred “by not
noting the variation which prevailed in the
mode of reckoning time.” The documents cited
in chapter iv. settle the point. The <i>Capitulacion</i>
under which Ponce de Leon sailed, was issued
at Burgos, Feb. 23, 1512. He could not possibly
by March 27 have returned to Porto Rico,
equipped a vessel, and reached Florida. The
letters of the King to Ceron and Diaz, in August
and December 1512, show that Ponce de Leon,
after returning to Porto Rico, was prevented
from sailing, and was otherwise employed. The
letter written by the King to the authorities in
Española, July 4, 1513, shows that he had
received from them information that Ponce de
Leon had sailed in that year.</p>

[The writing of his narrative, not during
but after the completion of his journey, does not
conduce to making the statements of the wanderer
very explicit, and different interpretations
of his itinerary can easily be made. In 1851
Mr. Smith made him cross the Mississippi within
the southern boundary of Tennessee, and so to
pass along the Arkansas and Canadian rivers
to New Mexico, crossing the Rio Grande in
the neighborhood of thirty-two degrees. In his
second edition he tracks the traveller nearer the
Gulf of Mexico, and makes him cross the Rio
Grande near the mouth of the Conchos River in
Texas, which he follows to the great mountain
chain, and then crosses it. Mr. Bartlett, the
editor of the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i> (see vol. i.
p. 188), who has himself tracked both routes, is
not able to decide between them. Davis, in his
<i>Conquest of New Mexico</i>, also follows Cabeza de
Vaca’s route. H. H. Bancroft (<i>North Mexican
States</i>, i. 63) finds no ground for the northern
route, and gives (p. 67) a map of what he supposes
to be the route. There is also a map
in Paul Chaix’ <i>Bassin du Mississipi au seizième
siècle</i>. Cf. also L. Bradford Prince’s <i>New
Mexico</i> (1883), p. 89.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>] The buffalo and
mesquite afford a tangible means of fixing the
limits of his route.</p>

Smith’s <i>Cabeça de Vaca</i>, p. 100; Torquemada
(<i>Monarquia Indiana</i>, 1723, iii. 437-447)
gives Lives of these friars. Barcia says Xuarez
was made a bishop; but Cabeza de Vaca never
calls him bishop, but simply commissary, and
the portrait at Vera Cruz has no episcopal emblems.
Torquemada in his sketch of Xuarez
makes no allusion to his being made a bishop.
and the name is not found in any list of
bishops. We owe to Mr. Smith another contribution
to the history of this region and this
time, in a <i>Coleccion de varios documentos para la
historia de la Florida y tierras adyacentes</i>,&mdash;only
vol. i. of the contemplated work appearing at
Madrid in 1857. It contained thirty-three important
papers from 1516 to 1569, and five from
1618 to 1794; they are for the most part from the
Simancas Archives. This volume has a portrait
of Ferdinand V., which is reproduced <i>ante</i>, p. 85.

dated April 20, 1537. In the following August
Cabeza de Vaca reached Spain, to find that Soto
had already secured the government of Florida;
and was thence turned to seek the government
of La Plata. It was probably before the tidings
of Narvaez’ expedition reached Spain that Soto
wrote the letter regarding a grant he wished in
Peru, which country he had left on the outbreak

[Rich in 1832 (no. 34) cited a copy at
£31 10<i>s.</i>, which at that time he believed to be
unique, and the identical one referred to by Pinelo
as being in the library of the Duque de
Sessa. There is a copy in the Grenville Collection,
British Museum, and another is in the
Lenox Library (B. Smith’s <i>Letter of De Soto</i>, p. 66).
It was reprinted at Lisbon in 1844 by the Royal
Academy at Lisbon (Murphy, no. 1,004; Carter-Brown,
vol. i. no. 596). Sparks says of it:
“There is much show of exactness in regard to
dates; but the account was evidently drawn up
for the most part from memory, being vague in
its descriptions and indefinite as to localities,
distances, and other points.” Field says it ranks
second only to the Relation of Cabeza de Vaca as
an early authority on the Indians of this region.
There was a French edition by Citri de la Guette
in 1685, which is supposed to have afforded a
text for the English translation of 1686 entitled
<i>A Relation of the Conquest of Florida by the Spaniards</i>
(see Field’s <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, nos. 325,
340). These editions are in Harvard College
Library. Cf. Sabin, <i>Dictionary</i>, vi. 488, 491, 492;

by Hernando de Soto</i>, New York, 1851. The first
edition appeared in 1835, and there were editions
printed in London in 1835 and 1850. The book
is a clever popularizing of the original sources,
with main dependence on Garcilasso (cf. Field,
<i>Indian Bibliography</i>, no. 765), whom its author
believes he can better trust, especially as regards
the purposes of De Soto, wherein he differs most
from the Gentleman of Elvas. Irving’s championship
of the Inca has not been unchallenged;
cf. Rye’s Introduction to the Hakluyt Society’s
volume. The Inca’s account is more than twice
as long as that of the Gentleman of Elvas, while
Biedma’s is very brief,&mdash;a dozen pages or so.

by Barcia at Madrid in 1723 (Carter-Brown, iii.

1803; and a French version by Pierre Richelet,

in 1670, 1709, 1711, 1731, 1735, and 1737
(Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,050; vol. iii. nos.

many notes, and again at Nordhausen in 1785.
The only English version is that embodied in
Bernard Shipp’s <i>History of Hernando de Soto and
Florida</i> (p. 229, etc.),&mdash;a stout octavo, published
in Philadelphia in 1881. Shipp uses, not the
original, but Richelet’s version, the Lisle edition
of 1711, and prints it with very few notes. His
book covers the expeditions to North America
between 1512 and 1568, taking Florida in its continental
sense; but as De Soto is his main hero,
he follows him through his Peruvian career.
Shipp’s method is to give large extracts from the
most accessible early writers, with linking abstracts,
making his book one mainly of compilation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda.</i> [The transcript
of the Fontaneda Memoir is marked by
Muñoz “as a very good account, although it is by
a man who did not understand the art of writing,
and therefore many sentences are incomplete.
On the margin of the original [at Simancas] are
points made by the hand of Herrera, who doubtless
drew on this for that part [of his <i>Historia
general</i>] about the River Jordan which he says
was sought by Ponce de Leon.” This memoir
on Florida and its natives was written in Spain
about 1575. It is also given in English in
French’s <i>Historical Collection of Louisiana</i> (1875),
p. 235, from the French of Ternaux; cf. Brinton’s

various notes and a comparative statement of
the authorities relative to the landing of De Soto

Llorente adds that he had a personal acquaintance
with a branch of the family at Calahorra,
his own birthplace, and that the first of
the family went to Spain, under Ferdinand III.,
to fight against the Moors of Andalusia. He
also traces a connection between this soldier
and Las Cases, the chamberlain of Napoleon,
one of his councillors and companions at St.
Helena, through a Charles Las Casas, one
of the Spanish seigneurs who accompanied
Blanche of Castile when she went to France,
in 1200, to espouse Louis VIII.</p>

There is a variance in the dates assigned
by historians for the visits of both Las Casas
and his father to the Indians. Irving, following
Navarrete, says that Antoine returned to Seville
in 1498, having become rich (<i>Columbus</i>
iii. 415). He also says that Llorente is incorrect
in asserting that Bartholomew in his
twenty-fourth year accompanied Columbus in
his third voyage, in 1498, returning with him
in 1500, as the young man was then at his
studies at Salamanca. Irving says Bartholomew
first went to Hispaniola with Ovando in
1502, at the age of about twenty-eight. I have
allowed the dates to stand in the text as given
by Llorente, assigning the earlier year for the
first voyage of Las Casas to the New World
as best according with the references in writings
by his own pen to the period of his
acquaintance with the scenes which he describes.</p>

The administration of affairs in the Western
colonies of Spain was committed by Ferdinand,
in 1511, to a body composed chiefly of clergy
and jurists, called “The Council for the Indies.”
Its powers originally conferred by Ferdinand
were afterward greatly enlarged by Charles
V. These powers were full and supreme, and any
information, petition, appeal, or matter of business
concerning the Indies, though it had been
first brought before the monarch, was referred
by him for adjudication to the Council. This
body had an almost absolute sway alike in matters
civil and ecclesiastical, with supreme authority
over all appointments and all concerns of
government and trade. It was therefore in the
power of the Council to overrule or qualify in
many ways the will or purpose or measures of
the sovereigns, which were really in favor of
right or justice or humane proceedings in the
affairs of the colonies. For it naturally came
about that some of its members were personally
and selfishly interested in the abuses and iniquities
which it was their rightful function and their
duty to withstand. At the head of the Council
was a dignitary whose well-known character
and qualities were utterly unfavorable for the
rightful discharge of his high trust. This was
Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, successively Bishop
of Badajoz, Valencia, and Burgos, and constituted
“Patriarch of the Indies.” He had full
control of colonial affairs for thirty years, till
near his death in 1547. He bore the repute
among his associates of extreme worldliness and
ambition, with none of the graces and virtues
becoming the priestly office, the duties of which
engaged but little of his time or regard. It is
evident also that he was of an unscrupulous
and malignant disposition. He was inimical to
Columbus and Cortés from the start. He tried
to hinder, and succeeded in delaying and embarrassing,
the second westward voyage of the great
admiral. (Irving’s <i>Columbus</i>, iii.; Appendix
XXXIV.) He was a bitter opponent of Las
Casas, even resorting to taunting insults of the
apostle, and either openly or crookedly thwarting
him in every stage and effort of his patient
importunities to secure the intervention of the
sovereigns in the protection of the natives.
The explanation of this enmity is found in the
fact that Fonseca himself was the owner of a
<i>repartimiento</i> in Hispaniola, with a large number
of native slaves.</p>

There is an extended Note on Las Casas
in Appendix XXVIII. of Irving’s <i>Columbus</i>.
That author most effectively vindicates Las
Casas from having first advised and been instrumental
in the introduction of African slavery
in the New World, giving the dates and
the advisers and agents connected with that
wrong previous to any word on the subject
from Las Casas. The devoted missionary had
been brought to acquiesce in the measure on
the plausible plea stated in the text, acting from
the purest spirit of benevolence, though under
an erroneous judgment. Cardinal Ximenes had
from the first opposed the project.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1018_1018" id="Footnote_1018_1018"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1018_1018"><span class="label">[1018]</span></a></span>
As will appear farther on in these pages,
Las Casas stands justly chargeable with enormous
exaggerations of the number or estimate of
the victims of Spanish cruelty. But I have not
met with a single case in any contemporary
writer, nor in the challengers and opponents
of his pleadings at the Court of Spain, in which
his hideous portrayal of the forms and methods
of that cruelty, its dreadful and revolting tortures
and mutilations, have been brought under
question. Mr. Prescott’s fascinating volumes
have been often and sometimes very sharply
censured, because in the glow of romance, chivalric
daring, and heroic adventure in which
he sets the achievements of the Spanish “Conquerors”
of the New World he would seem
to be somewhat lenient to their barbarities.
In the second of his admirable works he
refers as follows to this stricture upon him:
“To American and English readers, acknowledging
so different a moral standard from that
of the sixteenth century, I may possibly be
thought too indulgent to the errors of the Conquerors;”
and he urges that while he has “not
hesitated to expose in their strongest colors
the excesses of the Conquerors, I have given
them the benefit of such mitigating reflections
as might be suggested by the circumstances
and the period in which they lived” (Preface
to the <i>Conquest of Mexico</i>).</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is true that scattered over all the ably-wrought
pages of Mr. Prescott’s volumes are
expressions of the sternest judgment and the
most indignant condemnation passed upon the
most signal enormities of these incarnate spoilers,
who made a sport of their barbarity. But those
who have most severely censured the author
upon the matter now in view have done so under
the conviction that cruelty unprovoked and unrelieved
was so awfully dark and prevailing a
feature in every stage and incident of the Spanish
advance in America, that no glamour of
adventure or chivalric deeds can in the least
lighten or redeem it. The underlying ground
of variance is in the objection to the use of the
terms “Conquest” and “Conquerors,” as burdened
with the relation of such a pitiful struggle
between the overmastering power of the
invaders and the abject helplessness of their
victims.</p>
<p class="pfc4">As I am writing this note, my eye falls upon
the following extract from a private letter written
in 1847 by that eminent and highly revered
divine, Dr. Orville Dewey, and just now put
into print: “I have been reading Prescott’s
<i>Peru</i>. What a fine accomplishment there is
about it! And yet there is something wanting to
me in the moral nerve. History should teach
men how to estimate characters; it should be
a teacher of morals; and I think it should
make us <i>shudder</i> at the names of Cortez and
Pizarro. But Prescott does not; he seems to
have a kind of sympathy with these inhuman
and perfidious adventurers, as if they were his
heroes. It is too bad to talk of them as the
soldiers of Christ; if it were said of the Devil,
they would have better fitted the character”
(<i>Autobiography and Letters of Orville Dewey, D.D.</i>
p. 190).</p>

Juan Ginez de Sepulveda, distinguished
both as a theologian and an historian, was born
near Cordova in 1490, and died in 1573. He
was of a noble but impoverished family. He
availed himself of his opportunities for obtaining
the best education of his time in the universities
of Spain and Italy, and acquired an
eminent reputation as a scholar and a disputant,&mdash;not,
however, for any elevation of principles or
nobleness of thought. In 1536 he was appointed
by Charles V. his historiographer, and put in
charge of his son Philip. Living at Court, he
had the repute of being crooked and unscrupulous,
his influence not being given on the side
of rectitude and progressive views. His writings
concerning men and public affairs give evidence
of the faults imputed to him. He was
vehement, intolerant, and dogmatic. He justified
the most extreme absolutism in the exercise
of the royal prerogative, and the lawfulness
and even the expediency of aggressive wars
simply for the glory of the State. Melchior
Cano and Antonio Ramirez, as well as Las Casas,
entered into antagonism and controversy
with his avowed principles. One of his works,
entitled <i>Democrates Secundus, seu de justis belli
causis</i>, may be pronounced almost brutal in the
license which it allowed in the stratagems and
vengefulness of warfare. It was condemned by
the universities of Alcala and Salamanca. He
was a voluminous author of works of history,
philosophy, and theology, and was admitted to
be a fine and able writer. Erasmus pronounced
him the Spanish Livy. The disputation between
him and Las Casas took place before Charles in
1550. The monarch was very much under his
influence, and seems to some extent to have
sided with him in some of his views and principles.
Sepulveda was one of the very few persons
whom the monarch admitted to interviews
and intimacy in his retirement to the Monastery
at Yuste.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It was this formidable opponent&mdash;a personal
enemy also in jealousy and malignity&mdash;whom
Las Casas confronted with such boldness and
earnestness of protest before the Court and
Council. It was evidently the aim of Sepulveda
to involve the advocate of the Indians in some
disloyal or heretical questioning of the prerogatives
of monarch or pope. It seemed at one
time as if the noble pleader for equity and humanity
would come under the clutch of the
Holy Office, then exercising its new-born vigor
upon all who could be brought under inquisition
for constructive or latent heretical proclivities.
For Las Casas, though true to his priestly
vows, made frequent and bold utterances of
what certainly, in his time, were advanced views
and principles.</p>

Juan Antonio Llorente, eminent as a writer
and historian, both in Spanish and French, was
born near Calahorra, Aragon, in 1756, and died
at Madrid in 1823. He received the tonsure
when fourteen years of age, and was ordained
priest at Saragossa in 1779. He was of a vigorous,
inquisitive, and liberal spirit, giving free
range to his mind, and turning his wide study
and deep investigations to the account of his
enlargement and emancipation from the limitations
of his age and associates. He tells us that
in 1784 he had abandoned all ultramontane doctrines,
and all the ingenuities and perplexities of
scholasticism. His liberalism ran into rationalism.
His secret or more or less avowed alienation
from the prejudices and obligations of the
priestly order, while it by no means made his
position a singular or even an embarrassing
one under the influences and surroundings of
his time, does at least leave us perplexed to
account for the confidence with which functions
and high ecclesiastical trusts were committed to
and exercised by him. He was even made Secretary-General
of the Inquisition, and was thus
put in charge of the enormous mass of records,
with all their dark secrets, belonging to its
whole history and processes. This charge he
retained for a time after the Inquisition was
abolished in 1809. It was thus by a singular
felicity of opportunity that those terrible
archives should have been in the care, and
subject to the free and intelligent use, of a man
best qualified of all others to tell the world
their contents, and afterward prompted and at
liberty to do so from subsequent changes in his
own opinions and relations. To this the world
is indebted for a <i>History of the Inquisition</i>, the
fidelity and sufficiency of which satisfy all candid
judgments. He was restive in spirit, provoked
strong opposition, and was thus finally deprived
of his office. After performing a variety of
services not clerical, and moving from place to
place, he went to Paris, where, in 1817-1818, he
courageously published the above-mentioned
<i>History</i>. He was interdicted the exercise of
clerical functions. In 1822, the same year in
which he published his Biography and French
translation of the principal works of Las Casas,
he published also his <i>Political Portraits of the
Popes</i>. For this he was ordered to quit Paris,&mdash;a
deep disappointment to him, causing chagrin
and heavy depression. He found refuge
in Madrid, where he died in the following
year.</p>

<i>Conquest of Mexico</i>, i. 80, <i>n.</i> Of his <i>Short
Account of the Destruction of the Indies</i>, this historian
says: “However good the motives of its
author, we may regret that the book was ever
written.... The author lent a willing ear to
every tale of violence and rapine, and magnified
the amount to a degree which borders on the
ridiculous. The wild extravagance of his numerical
estimates is of itself sufficient to shake
confidence in the accuracy of his statements
generally. Yet the naked truth was too startling
in itself to demand the aid of exaggeration.”
The historian truly says of himself, in his Preface
to the work quoted: “I have not hesitated
to expose in their strongest colors the excesses
of the conquerors.”</p>

[Helps (<i>Spanish Conquest</i>) says: “Las
Casas may be thoroughly trusted whenever he
is speaking of things of which he had competent
knowledge.” Ticknor (<i>Spanish literature</i>,
ii. 31) calls him “a prejudiced witness, but on
a point of fact within his own knowledge one
to be believed.” H. H. Bancroft (<i>Early American
Chroniclers</i>, p. 20; also <i>Central America</i>, i.
274, 309; ii. 337) speaks of the exaggeration
which the zeal of Las Casas leads him into;
but with due abatement therefor, he considers
him “a keen and valuable observer, guided by

[Field says it was written in 1540, and submitted
to the Emperor in MS.; but in the shape
in which it was printed it seems to have been
written in 1541-1542. Cf. Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
nos. 860, 870; Sabin, <i>Works of Las
Casas</i>, no. 1; <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 164;
Ticknor, <i>Spanish Literature</i>, ii. 38; and <i>Catalogue</i>,
p. 62. The work has nineteen sections on
as many provinces, ending with a summary for
the year 1546. This separate tract was reprinted
in the original Spanish in London, in 1812, and
again in Philadelphia, in 1821, for the Mexican
market, with an introductory essay on Las Casas.

[There seems, according to Field (nos.
864, 865), to have been two distinct editions in
1552, as he deduces from his own copy and from
a different one belonging to Mr. Brevoort, there
being thirty-three variations in the two. Quaritch
has noted (no. 11,855, priced at £6 6<i>s.</i>) a copy
likewise in Gothic letter, but with different woodcut

[It is only of late years that the entire series
has been described. De Bure gives only five of
the tracts; Dibdin enumerates but seven; and
Llorente in his edition omits three, as was done
in the edition of 1646. Rich in 1832 priced a
set at £12 12<i>s.</i> A full set is now worth from
$100 to $150; but Leclerc (nos. 327, 2,556) has
recently priced a set of seven at 700 francs, and
a full set at 1,000 francs. An English dealer
has lately held one at £42. Quaritch has held
four parts at £10, and a complete set at £40.
Single tracts are usually priced at from £1 to
£5. Recent sales have been shown in the Sunderland
(no. 2,459, 9 parts); Field (no. 1,267);
Cooke (vol. iii. no. 369, 7 parts); Stevens, <i>Hist.
Coll.</i> (no. 311, 8 parts); Pinart (no. 536); and
Murphy (no. 487) catalogues. The set in the
Carter-Brown Library belonged to Ternaux; that
belonging to Mr. Brevoort came from the Maximillian
Library. The Lenox Library and Mr. Barlow’s
Collection have sets. There are also sets
in the Grenville and Huth collections.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The 1646 reprint, above referred to, has sometimes
a collective title, <i>Las Obras</i>, etc., but most
copies, like the Harvard College copy, lack it.
As the titles of the separate tracts (printed
in this edition in Roman) retained the original
1552 dates, this reprint is often called a spurious
edition. It is usually priced at from $15 to $30.

Mr. Stevens dedicates the tract to Sir Thomas
Phillipps. Cf. Stevens, <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. 883.</p>
<p class="pfc4">4. <i>Carta de Hernando Cortés.</i> Mr. Stevens, in
his Dedication to Leopold von Ranke, supposes
this to have been written in 1541-1542. It is
Cortes’ reply to the Emperor’s request for his
opinions regarding <i>Encomiendas</i>, etc., in Mexico.

Marina did more. She impressed Cortés,
who found her otherwise convenient for a few

Prescott (<i>Mexico</i>, revised edition, i. 345)
points out how this site was abandoned later
for one farther south, where the town was
called Vera Cruz Vieja; and again, early in the
seventeenth century, the name and town were
transferred to another point still farther south,&mdash;Nueva
Vera Cruz. These changes have
caused some confusion in the maps of Lorenzana
and others. Cf. the maps in Prescott and

The remains of Cortés have rested uneasily.
They were buried at Seville; but in 1562
his son removed them to New Spain and placed
them in a monastery at Tezcuco. In 1629 they
were carried with pomp to Mexico to the church
of St. Francis; and again, in 1794, they were
transferred to the Hospital of Jesus (Prescott,
<i>Mexico</i>, iii. 465), where a monument with a bust
was placed over them. In 1823, when a patriotic
zeal was turned into the wildness of a mob,
the tomb was threatened, and some soberer
citizens secretly removed the monument and
sent it (and later the remains) clandestinely to his
descendant, the Duke of Monteleone, in Palermo,
where they are supposed now to be, if the
story of this secret shipment is true (Prescott,
<i>Mexico</i>, iii. 335; Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>,
pp. 219, 220; Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, iii. 479, 480).
Testimony regarding the earlier interment and
exhumation is given in the <i>Coleccion de documentos
inéditos</i> (<i>España</i>), xxii. 563. Cf. B. Murphy
on “The Tomb of Cortés” in the <i>Catholic World</i>,
xxxiii. 24.</p>
<p class="pfc4">For an account of the family and descendants
of Cortés, see Bancroft, ii. 480; Prescott,

Indeed, the footnotes of Prescott are
meagre by comparison. The enumeration of the
manuscript sources on the Conquest given in
Charton’s <i>Voyageurs</i>, iii. 420, shows what provision
of this sort was most to be depended on
thirty years ago. There is a set of nine folios in
Harvard College Library, gathered by Lord
Kingsborough, called <i>Documentos para el historia
de México y Peru</i>. It includes some manuscripts;
but they are all largely, perhaps wholly,
of a later period than the Conquest.</p>

Quaritch, who in his <i>Catalogue</i> of 1870 (no.
259, <i>sub</i> 376) advertised for £105 the original
manuscripts of three at least of these councils
(1555, 1565, 1585), intimates that they never
were returned into the Ecclesiastical Archives
after Lorenzana had used them in preparing
an edition of the Proceedings of these Councils
which he published in 1769 and 1770,&mdash;<i>Concilios
provinciales de México</i>,&mdash;though in the third, and
perhaps in the first, he had translated apparently
his text from the Latin published versions. Bancroft
describes these manuscripts in his <i>Mexico</i>,
ii. 685. The Acts of the First Council had been
printed (1556) before Lorenzana; but the book
was suppressed, and the Acts of the Third Council
had been printed in 1622 in Mexico, and in
1725 at Paris. The Acts of the Third also appeared
in 1859 at Mexico with other documents.
The readiest source for the English reader of
the history of the measures for the conversion of
the Indians and for the relation of the Church to
the civil authorities in New Spain are sundry
chapters (viii., xix., etc.) in Bancroft’s <i>Central
America</i>, and others (ix., xix., xxxi., xxxii.) in his
<i>Mexico</i>. (Cf. references in Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer.
Vet.</i>, p. 209.) The leading Spanish authorities
are Torobio Motolinia, Mendieta, and Torquemada,
all characterized elsewhere. Alonso Fernandez’
<i>Historia eclesiástica de nuestros tiempos</i>
(Toledo, 1611) is full in elucidation of the lives of
the friars and of their study of the native tongues.
(Cf. Rich, 1832, £2 2<i>s.</i>; Quaritch, 1870, £5;
Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, ii. 190.) Gil Gonzales Davila’s
<i>Teatro eclesiástico de la primitiva Iglesia de las
Indias</i> (Madrid, 1649-1655) is more important
and rarer (Quaritch, 1870, £8 8<i>s.</i>; Rosenthal,
Munich, 1884, for 150 marks; Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>,
ii. 189). Of Las Casas and his efforts, see the
preceding chapter in the present volume.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Orders of friars are made the subject of
special treatment in Bancroft’s <i>Mexico</i>. The
Franciscans were the earliest to arrive, coming,
in response to the wish of Cortés, in 1524.
There are various histories of their labors,&mdash;Francisco
Gonzaga’s <i>De origine seraphicæ religionis
Franciscanæ</i>, Rome, 1587 (Carter-Brown,
i. 372); sections of Torquemada and the fourth
part of Vetancour’s <i>Teatro Mexicano</i>, Mexico,
1697-1698; Francisco Vasquez’ <i>Chronica ...
de Guatemala</i>, 1714; Espinosa’s <i>Chronica apostolica</i>,
1746 (Sabin, vi. 239; Carter-Brown, iii.
827), etc. Of the Dominicans we have Antonio
de Remesal’s <i>Historia de la S. Vincent de Chyapa</i>,
Madrid, 1619 (Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, ii. 339,
736), and Davilla Padilla’s <i>Santiago de México</i>,
mentioned in the text. Of the Augustinian friars
there is Juan de Grijalva’s <i>Cronica</i>, Mexico,
1624. Of the books on the Jesuits who came
late (1571, etc.), there is a note in Bancroft’s
<i>Mexico</i>, iii. 447, showing as of chief importance
Francisco de Florencia’s <i>Compañia de Jesus</i>
(Mexico, 1694), while the subject was taken up
under the same title by Francisco Javier Alegre,
who told the story of their missions from 1566
in Florida to 1765. The manuscript of this
work was not printed till Bustamante edited
it in 1841.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The legend or belief in our Lady of Guadalupe
gives a picturesque and significant coloring
to the history of missions in Mexico, since from
the day of her apparition the native worship, it
is said, steadily declined. It is briefly thus: In
1531 a native who had received a baptismal
name of Juan Diego, passing a hill neighboring
to the city of Mexico, was confronted by a
radiant being who announced herself as the
Virgin Mary, and who said that she wished a
church to be built on the spot. The native’s
story, as he told it to the Bishop, was discredited,
until some persons sent to follow the Indian
saw him disappear unaccountably from sight.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It was now thought that witchcraft more
than a heavenly interposition was the cause,
until, again confronting the apparition, Diego
was bidden to take some roses which the Lady
had handled and carry them in his mantle to
the Bishop, who would recognize them as a
sign. When the garment was unrolled, the figure
of the Virgin was found painted in its folds,
and the sign was accepted. A shrine was soon
erected, as the Lady had wished; and here the
holy effigy was sacredly guarded, until it found
a resting-place in what is thought to be the
richest church in Mexico, erected between 1695
and 1709; and there it still is. It has been at
times subjected to some ecclesiastical scrutiny,
and there have been some sceptics and cavillers.
Cf. Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, ii. 407, and authorities
there cited. Lorenzana in his <i>Cartas pastorales</i>
(1770) has given a minute account of the painting
(Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 1,749; Sabin,
vol, xii. no. 56,199; and the <i>Coleccion de obras
pertenecientes a la milagrosa aparicion de Nuestra
Señora de Guadalupe</i>).</p>

Carter-Brown, i. 496; Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, iii.
723. There is a copy in Harvard College
Library. There were later editions at Brussels
in 1625 (Carter-Brown, ii. 300; Stevens, <i>Historical
Collection</i>, i. 177), and again at Valladolid in
1634 as <i>Varia historia de la Nueva España y
Florida, segunda impresion</i> (Carter-Brown, ii.

We read in the 1596 edition (p. 670) that
one Juan Pablos was the first printer in Mexico,
who printed, as early as 1535, a religious manual
of Saint John Climachus. The book, however, is
not now known (Sabin, vi. 229), and there is no
indisputable evidence of its former existence;
though a similar story is told by Alonzo Fernandez
in his <i>Historia eclesiástica</i> (Toledo, 1611),
and by Gil Gonzales Davila in his <i>Teatro eclesiástico</i>
(Madrid, 1649),&mdash;who gives, however, the
date as 1532. The <i>Teatro</i> is of further interest
for the map of the diocese of Michoacan and
for the arms of the different dioceses. It is
in two volumes, and is worth from thirty to forty
dollars.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The subject of early printing in Mexico has
been investigated by Icazbalceta in the <i>Diccionario
universal de historia y de geografia</i>, v. 961
(published in Mexico in 1854), where he gives a
list of Mexican imprints prior to 1600 (Carter-Brown,
i. 129, 130). A similar list is given in
connection with an examination of the subject
by Harrisse in his <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 232.
Mr. John Russell Bartlett gives another list
(1540 to 1600) in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>,
i. 131, and offers other essays on the subject in
the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, November, 1858, and
February, 1865, and again in the new edition of
Thomas’s <i>History of Printing</i> (Worcester, 1875),
i. 365, appendix.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The earliest remaining example of the first
Mexican press which we have is a fragmentary
copy of the <i>Manual de adultos</i> of Cristóbal
Cabrera, which was originally discovered in the
Library of Toledo, whence it disappeared, to be
again discovered by Gayangos on a London
bookstall in 1870. It is supposed to have consisted
of thirty-eight leaves, and the printed date
of Dec. 13, 1540, is given on one of the leaves
which remain (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 232; <i>Additions</i>,
no. 123, with fac-similes, of which a part
is given in the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i>, i. 131).
Harrisse, perhaps, is in error, as Quaritch affirms
(<i>Ramirez Collection</i>, 1880, no. 339), in assigning
the same date, 1540, to an edition of the <i>Doctrina
Christiana</i> found by him at Toledo; and
there seem to have been one or two other books
issued by Cromberger (<i>Catalogue Andrade</i>, nos.
2,366, 2,367, 2,369, 2,477) before we come to an
acknowledged edition of the <i>Doctrina Cristiana</i>&mdash;which
for a long time was held to be the
earliest Mexican imprint&mdash;with the date of 1544.
It is a small volume of sixty pages, “impressa
en México, en casa de Juan Cromberger” (Rich,
1832, no. 14; Sabin, vol. iv, no. 16,777; Carter-Brown,
i. 134, with fac-similes of title; <i>Bookworm</i>,
1867, p. 114; Quaritch, no. 321, <i>sub</i> 12,551).
Of the same date is Dionisio Richel’s <i>Compendio
breve que tracta a’ la manera de como se hā de
hazer las processiones</i>, also printed, as the earlier
one was, by command of Bishop Zumarraga,
this time with a distinct date,&mdash;“Año de M. D.
<i>xliiij</i>.” A copy which belonged to the Emperor
Maximilian was sold in the Andrade sale (no.
2,667), and again in the Brinley sale (no. 5,317).
Quaritch priced Ramirez’ copy in 1880 at £52.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The lists above referred to show eight separate
issues of the Mexican press before 1545. Icazbalceta
puts, under 1548, the <i>Doctrina en Mexicano</i>
as the earliest instance known of a book
printed in the native tongue. Up to 1563, with
the exception of a few vocabularies and grammars
of the languages of the country, of the less
than forty books which are known to us, nearly
all are of a theological or devotional character.
In that year (1663) Vasco de Puga’s Collection
of Laws&mdash;<i>Provisiones, cédulas, instrucciones de su
Majestad</i>&mdash;was printed (Quaritch, <i>Ramirez Collection</i>,
1880, no. 236, £30). Falkenstein in his
<i>Geschichte der Buchdruckerkunst</i> (Leipsic, 1840)
has alleged, following Pinelo and others, that a
Collection of Laws&mdash;<i>Ordinationes legumque collectiones</i>&mdash;was
printed in 1649; but the existence
of such a book is denied. Cf. Thomas, <i>History
of Printing</i>, i. 372; Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>,
no. 288.</p>

Navarrete first printed it in his <i>Coleccion</i>, i. 421; it was included also in Vedia’s <i>Historiadores primitivos
de Indias</i> (Madrid, 1852); and Gayangos, in his <i>Cartas de Hernan Cortés</i> (Paris, 1866) does not hesitate to let
it stand for the first letter, while he also annotates it. It is likewise printed in the <i>Biblioteca de autores
Españoles</i>, vol. xxii., and by Alaman in his <i>Disertaciones sobre la historia de la República Mejicana</i>, vol. i.,
appendix, with a sketch of the expedition. Cf. Prescott’s <i>Mexico</i>, i. 360, iii. 428; H. H. Bancroft’s <i>Mexico</i>, i.

Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, i. 170. It is supposed that still a third letter went at the same time, which is now
known to us. Three letters of this time were found in 1866 among some old account-books in a library sold
in Austria. Two of them proved to be written in Spain upon the news of Cortés’ discoveries, while one was
written by a companion of Cortés shortly after the landing on the Mexican coast, but is not seemingly an
original, for it is written in German, and the heading runs: <i>Newzeit wie unnsers aller-gnadigistn hern des
Romischn und hyspaenischn Koningsleut Ain Costliche Newe Lanndschafft habn gefundn</i>, and bears date
June 28, 1519. There are some contradictions in it to the received accounts; but these are less important than
the mistake of a modern French translator, who was not aware of the application of the name of Yucatan, at
that time, to a long extent of coast, and who supposed the letters referred to Grijalva’s expedition. The
original text, with a modern German and French version, appears in a small edition (thirty copies) which
Frederic Muller, of Amsterdam, printed from the original manuscript (cf. his <i>Books on America</i>, 1872, no.
1,144; 1877, no. 2,296, priced at 120 florins) under the title of <i>Trois lettres sur la découverte de Yucatan</i>,
Amsterdam, 1871 (Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 66; Muller, <i>Books on America</i>, 1877, no. 2,296; C. H. Berendt
in <i>American Bibliopolist</i>, July and August, 1872; Murphy, no. 2,795).</p>
<p class="pfc4">One of the news-sheets of the time, circulated in Europe, is preserved in the Royal Library at Berlin.
A photo-lithographic fac-simile was published (one hundred copies) at Berlin in 1873. It is called: <i>Newe
Zeittung. von dem lande. das die Sponier funden haben ym 1521. iare genant Iucatan</i>. It is a small quarto
in gothic type, of four unnumbered leaves, with a woodcut. Cf. <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 70, with fac-simile

There are curious stories about this book, in which there is not entire accord with one another. The fact
seems to be that Bustamante got hold of the manuscript, and supposed it an original work of Chimalpain, and
announced it for publication in a Spanish dress, as translated from the Nahuatl, under the title of <i>Historia de
las conquistas de Hernando Cortés</i>, under which name it appeared in two volumes in Mexico in 1826 (<i>Ticknor
Catalogue</i>, p. 207). Bandelier and others referring to it have supposed it to be what the title represented
(<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, new series, i. 84; cf. <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, p. 204); but it is printed in Spanish nevertheless,
and is nothing more than a translation of Gomara. Bustamante in his preface does not satisfy the
reader’s curiosity, and this Mexican editor’s conduct in the matter has been the subject of apology and suspicion.
Cf. Quaritch’s <i>Catalogues</i>, nos. 11,807, 12,043, 17,632; H. H. Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, i. 315;
Sabin, vii. no. 27,753. Quaritch adds that Bustamante’s text seems rather like a modern improvement of
Gomara than a retranslation, and that a manuscript apparently different and called Chimalpain’s history was
sold in the Abbé Fischer’s sale in 1869.</p>

It is a small folio, and has become extremely rare, owing, perhaps, in part to the attempted suppression
of it. Quaritch in 1883 priced a copy at £75. It should have two maps, one of the Indies, the other of the
Old World (Ternaux, no. 61; Carter-Brown, nos. 177, 178; Sunderland, vol. iii. no. 7,575; <i>Library of an Elizabethan

Carter-Brown, vol. i. nos. 179, 180; Sabin, vol. vii. no. 27,725; Leclerc, 800 francs. Mr. J. C. Brevoort
has a copy. Sabin (no. 27,726) notes a <i>Conquista de México</i> (Madrid, 1553) which he has not seen, but
describes it at second hand as having the royal arms where the Medina edition has the arms of Cortés, and
intimates that this last may have been the cause of the alleged suppression.</p>

Antwerp editions,&mdash;<i>Historia general</i>, Nucio, Steelsio, and Bellero; <i>Historia de México</i>, Bellero, Lacio, Steelsio;

with the Steelsio and Bellero imprints, and copies of the <i>Historia general</i> with the imprints of Bellero and
Martin Nucio. Quaritch prices the Bellero <i>México</i> at £5 5<i>s.</i> Rich priced it in 1832 at £3 3<i>s.</i> There is a
Steelsio México in the Boston Public Library. Cf. <i>Huth Catalogue</i>, ii. 605; Murphy, nos. 1,057-1,059;
Court, nos. 146, etc. Of the later Spanish texts, that in Barcia’s <i>Historiadores primitivos</i> (1748-1749) is mutilated;
the best is that in the <i>Biblioteca de autores Españoles</i>, published at Madrid in 1852.</p>

Such, at least, is the condition of the copy in Harvard College Library; while the two titles are attached

Athenæum. Cf. <i>O’Callaghan Catalogue</i>, no. 989. Sabin (vol. vii. nos. 27,734-27,735) says the 1555 title is a
cancelled one. Mr. Brevoort possesses a <i>Historia generale delle Indie occidentali</i> (Rome, 1556), which he calls
a translation of part i. Cf. Sabin, vol. vii. no. 27,736; Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 200. F. S. Ellis (1884, no.
111) prices a copy at £2 2<i>s.</i> Sabin (no. 27,737) also notes a Gomara, as published in 1557 at Venice, as the
second part of a history, of which Cieza de Leon’s was the first part.</p>

<i>Historie del Peru</i> was the first part, and Gomara’s <i>Conquista di Messico</i> (1566) was the third. This Italian
translation was made by Lucio Mauro. The three parts are in Harvard College Library and in the Boston
Public Library (Sabin, vol. vii. no. 27,738).</p>

du Capitaine Ferdinand Courtois</i>. Cf. Sabin, vol. iv. no. 16,955. Harrisse says that Oviedo, as
well as Gomara, was used in this production. There were later French texts in 1604, 1605, and 1606. Cf.
Carter-Brown, vol. ii. nos. 34, 46; Rich (1832), no. 104; Sabin (vol. vii. no. 27,749) also says of the 1606

Scherzer (in his edition of Ximenes’ <i>Las historias del origen de los Indios de esta provincia de
Guatemala</i>, 1857) says that the text as published is very incorrect, and adds that the original manuscript is in
the city library at Guatemala. Brasseur says he has seen it there. It is said to have a memorandum to show
that it was finished in 1605 at Guatemala. We have no certain knowledge of Diaz’ death to confirm the
impression that he could have lived to the improbable age which this implies. (Cf. <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, i. 129, 328-329.) There are two editions of it, in different type, which have the seal of authenticity.
One was dated in 1632; the other, known as the second edition, is without date, and has an additional chapter
(numbered wrongly ccxxii.) concerning the portents among the Mexicans which preceded the coming of the
Spaniards. It is explained that this was omitted in the first edition as not falling within the personal
observation of Diaz. (Cf. Sabin, vol. vi. nos. 19,978, 19,979; Carter-Brown, ii. 387; Murphy, no. 790; Court,
nos. 106, 107; Leclerc, no. 1,115. Rich priced it in his day at $10; it now usually brings about $30.) There
are later editions of the Spanish text,&mdash;one issued at Mexico in 1794-1795, in four small volumes (Sabin, vol. vi.
no. 19,980; Leclerc, no. 1,117, 40 francs); a second, Paris, 1837 (Sabin, vol. vi. no. 19,981); and another, published
in 1854, in two quarto volumes, with annotations from the Cortés letters, etc. It is also contained in Vedia’s
edition of the <i>Historiadores primitivos</i>, vol. ii. There are three German editions, one published at Hamburg
in 1848, with a preface by Karl Ritter, and others bearing date at Bonn, 1838 and 1843 (Sabin, vi. no.
19,986-19,987). There are two English versions,&mdash;one by Maurice Keating, published at London in 1800
(with a large map of the Lake of Mexico), which was reprinted at Salem, Mass., in 1803 (Sabin, vol. vi. nos.
19,984-19,985). Mr. Deane points out how Keating, without any explanation, transfers from chap. xviii. and
other parts of the text sundry passages to a preface. A second English translation,&mdash;<i>Memoirs of Diaz</i>,&mdash;by
John Ingram Lockhart, was published in London in 1844 (Sabin, vol. vi. no. 19,983), and is also included
in Kerr’s <i>Voyages</i>, vols. iii. and iv. Munsell issued an abridged English translation by Arthur Prynne
at Albany in 1839 (Sabin, vol. vi. no. 19,982). The best annotated of the modern issues is a French translation
by D. Jourdanet, <i>Histoire véridique de la conquête de la Nouvelle Espagne</i>, Paris, 1876. In the following
year a second edition was issued, accompanied by a study on the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, and enriched
with notes, a bibliography, and a chapter from Sahagun on the vices of the Mexicans. It also contained a
modern map of Mexico, showing the marches of Cortés; the map of the valley, indicating the contraction of
the lake (the same as used by Jourdanet in other works), and a reproduction of a map of the lake illustrating
the operations of Cortés, which follows a map given in the Mexican edition of Clavigero. A list of the <i>Conquistadores</i>
gives three hundred and seventy-seven names, which are distinguished apart as constituting the
followers of Cortés, Camargo, Salcedo, Garay, Narvaez, and Ponçe de Leon. This list is borrowed from the
<i>Diccionario universal de historia y de geografia, ... especialmente sobre la república Mexicana</i>, 1853-1856.
(Cf. <i>Norton’s Literary Gazette</i>, Jan. 15, 1835, and <i>Revue des questions historiques</i>, xxiii. 249.) This <i>Diccionario</i>
was published at Mexico, in 1853-1856, in ten volumes, based on a similar work printed in Spain, but
augmented in respect to Mexican matters by various creditable collaborators, while vols. viii., ix., and x.
are entirely given to Mexico, and more particularly edited by Manuel Orozco y Berra. The work is worth
about 400 francs. The <i>Cartas de Indias</i> (Madrid, 1877) contained a few unpublished letters of Bernal Diaz.</p>

Sahagun’s study of the Aztec tongue was a productive one. Biondelli published at Milan in 1858, from
a manuscript by Sahagun, an <i>Evangelarium epistolarium et lectionarium Aztecum sive Mexicanum, ex
antiquo codice Mexicano nuper reperto</i>; and Quaritch in 1880 (<i>Catalogue</i>, p. 46, no. 261, etc.) advertised various
other manuscripts of his <i>Sermones in Mexicano</i>, etc. Jourdanet in his edition (p. x.) translates the opinion
of Sahagun given by his contemporary and fellow-Franciscan, Fray Geronimo Mendieta, in his <i>Historia eclesiastica
Indiana</i> (Mexico, 1860) p. 633. There is a likeness of Sahagun in Cumplido’s edition of Prescott’s
<i>Mexico</i>, published at Mexico in 1846, vol. iii.</p>

In the introduction to this volume Brasseur reviews the native writers on the Conquest. Bancroft
(<i>Mexico</i>, vol. i. p. 493, vol. ii. p. 488) thinks he hardly does Cortés justice, and is prone to accept without discrimination
the native accounts, to the discredit of those of the conquerors. Brasseur gives abundant references;
and since the publication of the <i>Pinart-Brasseur Catalogue</i>, we have a compact enumeration of his
own library.</p>

Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, vol. i. p. 686. Bandelier has given a partial list of the authorities on the
conquest of Guatemala in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, October, 1880; and Bancroft (<i>Central America</i>, vol. i.
p. 703, vol. ii. p. 736) characterizes the principal sources. Helps (end of book xv. of his <i>Spanish Conquest</i>)
complained of the difficulty in getting information of the Guatemala affairs; but Bancroft makes use of all the
varied published collections of documents on Spanish-American history, which contain so much on Guatemala;
and to his hands, fortunately, came also all the papers of the late E. G. Squier. A <i>Coleccion de Documentos Antiguos
de Guatemala</i>, published in 1857, has been mentioned elsewhere, as well as the <i>Proceso</i> against Alvarado,
so rich in helpful material. The general historians must all be put under requisition in studying this theme,&mdash;Oviedo,
Gomara, Diaz, Las Casas, Ixtlilxochitl, and Herrera, not to name others. Antonio de Remesal’s is the
oldest of the special works, and was written on the spot. His <i>Historia de Chyapa</i> is a Dominican’s view; and
being a partisan, he needs more or less to be confirmed. A Franciscan friar, Francisco Vasquez, published a
<i>Chronica de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de Guatemala</i> in 1714, a promised second volume
never appearing. He magnified the petty doings of his brother friars; but enough of historical interest crept
into his book, together with citations from records no longer existing, to make it valuable. He tilts against
Remesal, while he constantly uses his book; and the antagonism of the Franciscans and Dominicans misguides
him sometimes, when borrowing from his rival. He lauds the conquerors, and he suffers the charges of cruelty to
be made out but in a few cases (Bancroft, <i>Central America</i>, vol. ii. pp. 142, 736). The <i>Historia de Guatemala</i>
of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzman is quoted by Bancroft from a manuscript copy (<i>Central America</i>,
vol. ii. p. 736), but it has since been printed in Madrid in 1882-1883, in two volumes, with annotations by Justo
Zaragoza, as one of the series <i>Biblioteca de los Americanistes</i>. Bancroft thinks he has many errors and that he
is far from trustworthy, wherever his partiality for the conquerors is brought into play. The chief modern historian
of Guatemala is Domingo Juarros, who was born in that city in 1752, and died in 1820. His <i>Compendio de
la historia de la Ciudad de Guatemala</i> was published there, the first volume in 1808 and the second in 1818; and
both were republished in 1857. It was published in English in London in 1823, with omissions and inaccuracies,&mdash;according
to Bancroft. The story of the Conquest is told in the second volume. Except so far as he
followed Fuentes, in his partiality for the conquerors, Juarros’ treatment of his subject is fair; and his industry
and facilities make him learned in its details. Bancroft (<i>Central America</i>, vol. ii. pp. 142, 737) remarks
on his omission to mention the letters of Alvarado, and doubts, accordingly, if Juarros could have known
of them.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of the despatches which Alvarado sent to Cortés, we know only two. Bandelier (<i>American Antiquarian
Society’s Proceedings</i>, October, 1880) says that Squier had copies of them all; but Bancroft (<i>Central America</i>,
vol. i. p. 666), who says he has all of Squier’s papers, makes no mention of any beyond the two,&mdash;of April 11
and July 28, 1524,&mdash;which are in print in connection with Cortés’ fourth letter, in Ramusio’s version, except
such as are of late date (1534-1541), of which he has copies, as his list shows (Cf. also Ternaux, vol. x., and
Barcia, vol. i. p. 157). Ternaux is said to have translated from Ramusio. Oviedo uses them largely, word for
word. Herrera is supposed to have used a manuscript History of the Conquest of Guatemala by Gonzalo de
Alvarado.</p>

The original edition of the <i>De natura</i> is scarce. Rich priced it at £1 1<i>s.</i> fifty years ago; Leclerc,
no. 2,639, at 150 francs (cf. also Carter-Brown, i. 379; Sabin, i. 111,&mdash;for a full account of successive
editions; Sunderland, i. 23). It was reprinted at Salamanca in 1595, and at Cologne in 1596. The
latter edition can usually be bought for $3 or $4. Cf. Field, no. 9; Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, no. 9;
Murphy, no. 11, etc.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1201_1201" id="Footnote_1201_1201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1201_1201"><span class="label">[1201]</span></a></span>
Rich priced it in 1832 at £1 10<i>s.</i>; ordinary copies are now worth about £2 or £3, but fine copies
in superior binding have reached £12 12<i>s.</i> (Cf. Leclerc, no. 5&mdash;200 francs; Sunderland, i. 24; J. A. Allen,
<i>Bibliography of Cetacea</i>, p. 24,&mdash;where this and other early books on America are recorded with the utmost
care.) Other Spanish editions are Helmstadt, 1590 (Bartlett); Seville, 1591 (Brunet, Backer); Barcelona,
1591 (Carter-Brown, i. 478; Leclerc, no. 7); Madrid, 1608 (Carter-Brown, ii, 61; Leclerc, no. 8) and 1610
(Sabin); Lyons, 1670; and Madrid, 1792, called the best edition, with a notice of Acosta.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The French editions followed rapidly: Paris, by R. Regnault, 1597 (Brunet, Markham); 1598 (Leclerc,
no. 10&mdash;100 francs; Dufossé, 125 francs, 140 francs, 160 francs); 1600 (Leclerc, no. 11; Bishop Huet’s
copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris has notes which are printed by Camus in his book on De Bry);
1606 (Leclerc, nos. 12, 13); 1616 (Carter-Brown, ii. 177; Leclerc, no. 2,639&mdash;50 francs); 1617 (Leclerc,
no. 14); 1619 (Sabin); 1621 (Rich). An Italian version, made by Gallucci, was printed at Venice in 1596
(Leclerc, no. 15).</p>
<p class="pfc4">There were more liberties taken with it in German. It was called <i>Geographische und historische Beschreibung
der America</i>, when printed at Cologne in 1598, with thirty maps, as detailed in the <i>Carter-Brown
Catalogue</i>, i. 520. Antonio (<i>Biblioteca Hispana Nova</i>) gives the date 1599. At Cologne again in 1600
it is called <i>New Welt</i> (Carter-Brown, i. 548), and at Wesel, in 1605, <i>America oder West India</i>, which is
partly the same as the preceding (Carter-Brown, ii. 31). Antonio gives an edition in 1617.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Dutch translation, following the 1591 Seville edition, was made by Linschoten, and printed at Haarlem
in 1598 (Leclerc, no. 16); and again, with woodcuts, in 1624 (Carter-Brown, ii. 287; Murphy, no. 9). It is
also in Vander Aa’s collection, 1727. It was from the Dutch version that it was turned (by Gothard Arthus
for De Bry in his <i>Great Voyages</i>, part ix.) into German, in 1601; and into Latin, in 1602 and 1603.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The first English translation did not appear till 1604, at London, as <i>The naturall and morall historie of
the East und West Indies. Intreating of the remarkable things of Heaven, of the Elements, Mettalls, Plants,
and Beasts which are proper to that Country; Together with the Manners, Ceremonies, Lawes, Governements,
and Warres of the Indians. Written in Spanish by Ioseph Acosta, and translated into English by
E[dward] G[rimston].</i> Rich priced it fifty years ago at £1 16s.; it is usually priced now at from four to eight
guineas (cf. Carter-Brown, ii. 21; Field, no. 8; Menzies, no. 4; Murphy, no. 8). It was reprinted, with
corrections of the version, and edited by C. R. Markham for the Hakluyt Society in 1880.</p>

This is extremely rare. Quaritch, who said in 1879 that only three copies had turned up in London
in thirty years, prices an imperfect copy at £5. (<i>Catalogue</i>, no. 326 <i>sub.</i> no. 17,635.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is worth while to note how events in the New World, during the early part of the sixteenth century,
were considered in their relation to European history. Cf. for instance, Ulloa’s <i>Vita dell’imperator Carlo V.</i>
(Rome, 1562), and such chronicles as the <i>Anales de Aragon</i>, first and second parts. Harrisse (<i>Bibl. Amer.
Vet.</i> and <i>Additions</i>), and the <i>Carter-Brown Catalogue</i> (vol. i.) will lead the student to this examination, in
their enumeration of books only incidentally connected with America. To take but a few as representative:</p>
<p class="pfc4">Maffeius, <i>Commentariorum urbanorum libri</i>, Basle, 1530, with its chapter on “loca nuper reperta.”
(Harrisse, <i>Additions</i>, no. 93; edition of 1544, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i> no. 257, and <i>Additions</i>, no. 146. Fabricius
cites an edition as early as 1526.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">Laurentius Frisius, <i>Der Cartha Marina</i>, Strasburg, 1530. (Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 151;
<i>Addition</i>s, no. 90.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">Gemma Phrysius, <i>De Principiis Astronomiæ et Cosmographicæ</i>, with its cap. xxix., “De insulis nuper
inventis.” (Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 92.) There are later editions in 1544 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>,
no. 252), 1548; also Paris, in French, 1557, etc.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Sebastian Franck, <i>Weltbuch</i>, Tübingen, 1533-1534, in which popular book of its day a separate chapter
is given to America. The book in this first edition is rare, and is sometimes dated 1533, and again 1534.
(Cf. Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, nos. 174, 197; Sabin, vi. 570; Carter-Brown, i. 111; Muller, 1877, no. 1,151;
H. H. Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, i. 250.) There was another edition in 1542 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 238; Stevens,
<i>Bbliotheca Historica</i>, no. 738), and later in Dutch and German, in 1558, 1567, 1595, etc. (Leclerc, nos. 212,
217, etc.).</p>
<p class="pfc4">George Rithaymer, <i>De orbis terrarum</i>, Nuremberg, 1538, with its “De terris et insulis nuper repertis”
(<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 119).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Achilles P. Gassarum, <i>Historiarum et chronicarum mundi epitomes libellus</i>, Venice, 1538, with its
“insulæ in oceano antiquioribus ignotæ.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Ocampo, <i>Chronica general de España</i>, 1543, who, in mentioning the discovery of the New World, forgets
to name Columbus (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, no. 242; Sabin, vol. xiii.).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Guillaume Postel, <i>De orbis terræ concordia</i>, Basle, about 1544 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 145).</p>
<p class="pfc4">John Dryander, <i>Cosmographiæ introductio</i>, 1544 (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet., Additions</i>, no. 147).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Biondo, <i>De ventis et navigatione</i>, Venice, 1546, with cap. xxv. on the New World (<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>,
no. 274).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Professor J. R. Seeley, in his <i>Expansion of England</i> (p. 78), has pointed out how events in the New
World did not begin to react upon European politics, till the attacks of Drake and the English upon the
Spanish West Indies instigated the Spanish Armada, and made territorial aggrandizement in the New World as
much a force in the conduct of politics in Europe as the Reformation had been. The power of the great

Sabin, vol. xii. no. 47,812. Icazbalceta showed Torquemada’s debt to Mendieta by collations. (Bancroft,
<i>Mexico</i>, ii. 668.) No author later than Torquemada cites it. Barcia was not able to find it, and it was considered
as hopelessly lost. In 1860 its editor was informed that the manuscript had been found among the papers
left by D. Bartolomé José Gallardo. Later it was purchased by D. José M. Andrade, and given to Icazbalceta,
at whose expense it has been published (<i>Boston Public Library Catalogue</i>).</p>

numerous in various languages. Most of them may be found noted in the following list:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>In Spanish.</i> Barcelona, 1691, accompanied by a Life of Solis, by Don Juan de Goyeneche, Madrid, 1704,
a good edition; Brussels, 1704, with numerous plates; Madrid, 1732, two columns, without plates; Brussels,
1741, with Goyeneche’s Life; Madrid, 1748, said to have been corrected by the author’s manuscript; Barcelona,
1756; Madrid, 1758; Madrid, 1763; Barcelona, 1771; Madrid, 1776; Madrid, 1780; Madrid, 1783-1784,&mdash;a
beautiful edition, called by Stirling “the triumph of the press of Sancha” (cf. Ticknor Catalogue, p. 335;
Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,300); Barcelona, 1789; Madrid, 1791, 1798, 1819, 1822; Paris, 1827; Madrid,
1828, 1829, 1838; Barcelona, 1840; Paris, 1858, with notes. Sabin (vol. iv. nos. 16,944-16,945) gives abridged
editions,&mdash;Barcelona, 1846, and Mexico, 1853. An edition, London, 1809, is “Corregida por Augustin Luis
Josse,” and is included in the <i>Biblioteca de autores españoles</i>, in 1853.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>In French.</i> The earliest translation was made by Bon André de Citri et de la Guette, and appeared with
two different imprints in Paris in 1691 in quarto (Carter-Brown, vol. ii. 1427-1428). Other editions followed,&mdash;La
Haye, 1692, in 12mo; Paris, 1704, with folding map and engravings reduced from the Spanish editions;
Paris, 1714, with plates; Paris, 1730, 1759, 1774, 1777, 1844, etc.; and a new version by Philippe de Toulza,
with annotations, published in Paris in 1868.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>In Italian.</i> The early version was published at Florence in 1699, with portraits of Solis, Cortés, and
Montezuma (Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,577). An edition at Venice in 1704 is without plates; but another, in
1715, is embellished. There was another at Venice in 1733.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>In Danish.</i> Copenhagen, 1747 (Carter-Brown, vol. iii. no. 859).</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>In English.</i> Thomas Townsend’s English version was published in London in 1724, and was reissued,
revised by R. Hooke in 1753, both having a portrait of Cortés, by Vertue, copied “after a head by Titian,”
with other folding plates based on those of the Spanish editions (Carter-Brown, vol. iii. nos. 350, 588; Field,
<i>Indian Bibliography</i>, nos. 1,464, 1,465). There were later editions in 1753.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It was when he was twenty-eight years old, that Prescott took his first lesson in Spanish history in
reading Solis, at Ticknor’s recommendation.</p>

The story as the English had had it up to this time&mdash;except so far as they learned it in translations of
Solis&mdash;may be found in Burke’s <i>European Settlements in America</i>, 1765, part i. pp. 1-166.</p>

Sabin, vol. iv. no. 13,518. It was written in Spanish, but translated into Italian for publication. A
Spanish version, <i>Historia Antigua de Mégico</i>, made by Joaquin de Mora, was printed in London in 1826, and
reprinted in Mexico in 1844 (Leclerc, nos. 1,103, 1,104, 2,712). A German translation, <i>Geschichte von Mexico</i>,
was issued at Leipsic in 1789-1790, with notes. This version is not made from the original Italian, but from
an English translation printed in London in 1787 as <i>The History of Mexico</i>, translated by Charles Cullen.
It was reprinted in London in 1807, and in Philadelphia in 1817 (Field, <i>Indian Bibliography</i>, p. 326).</p>

Mr. H. H. Bancroft (<i>Mexico</i>, vol. i, p. 7, <i>note</i>), however, charges his predecessor with parading his
acquisition of this then unprinted material, and with neglecting the more trustworthy and more accessible
chroniclers. He also speaks (<i>Mexico</i>, i. 701) of an amiable weakness in Prescott which sacrificed truth to
effect, and to a style which he calls “magnificent,” and to a “philosophic flow of thought,”&mdash;the latter trait
in Prescott being one of his weakest; nor is his style what rhetoricians would call “magnificent.”</p>

Cf. the collation of criticisms on the <i>Mexico</i>, given by Allibone in his <i>Dictionary of Authors</i>, and by Poole
in his <i>Index to Periodical Literature</i>. Archbishop Spalding, in his <i>Miscellanea</i>, chapters xiii. and xiv., gives the
Catholic view of his labors; and Ticknor, in his <i>Life of Prescott</i>, prints various letters from Hallam, Sismondi,
and others, giving their prompt expressions regarding the book. In chapters xiii., xiv., and xv. of this book
the reader may trace Prescott through the progress of the work, not so satisfactorily as one might wish however,
for in his diaries and letters the historian failed often to give the engaging qualities of his own character.
It is said that Carlyle, when applied to for letters of Prescott which might be used by Ticknor in his Life of
the historian, somewhat rudely replied that he had never received any from Prescott worth preserving. Prescott’s
library is, unfortunately, scattered. He gave some part of it to Harvard College, including such manuscripts
as he had used in his <i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>; and some years after his death a large part of it was
sold at public auction. It was then found that, with a freedom which caused some observation, the marks of his
ownership had been removed from his books. Many of his manuscripts and his noctograph were then sold,
perhaps through inadvertence, for the family subsequently reclaimed what they could. The noctograph and
some of the manuscripts are now in the cabinet of the Massachusetts Historical Society (cf. <i>Proceedings</i>, vol.
xiii. p. 66), and other manuscripts are in the Boston Public Library (<i>Bulletin of Boston Public Library</i>, iv. 122).
A long letter to Dr. George E. Ellis, written in 1857, and describing his use of the noctograph, is in the same
volume (Proceedings, vol. xiii. p. 246). The estimate in which Prescott was held by his associates of that
Society may be seen in the records of the meeting at which his death was commemorated, in 1859 (<i>Proceedings</i>,
iv. 167, 266). There is a eulogy of Prescott by George Bancroft in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, iii. 69. Cf.
references in Poole’s <i>Index</i>, p. 1047.</p>

is “that no complete account of real value has been written.” Andrés Cavo’s <i>Tres siglos de México</i> (Mexico,
1836-1838, in three volumes) is but scant on the period of the Conquest (Bancroft, <i>Mexico</i>, iii. 508). It was

The general bibliographies of American history are examined in a separate section of the present work
and elsewhere in the present chapter something has been said of the bibliographical side of various other phases
of the Mexican theme. Mr. A. F. Bandelier has given a partial bibliography of Yucatan and Central America,
touching Mexico, however, only incidentally, in the <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, October, 1880. Harrisse, in his
<i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, p. 212, has given a partial list of the poems and plays founded upon the Conquest. Others
will be found in the <i>Chronological List of Historical Fiction</i> published by the Boston Public Library. Among
the poems are Gabriel Lasso de la Vega’s <i>Cortés Valeroso</i>, 1588, republished as <i>Mexicana</i> in 1594 (Maisonneuve,
no. 2,825&mdash;200 francs); Saavedra Guzman’s <i>El Peregrino indiano</i>, Madrid, 1599 (Rich, 1832, no. 86,
£4 4<i>s.</i>); Balbuena’s <i>El Bernardo</i>, a conglomerate heroic poem (Madrid, 1624), which gives one book to the
Conquest by Cortés (Leclerc, no. 48&mdash;100 francs); Boesnier’s <i>Le Mexique Conquis</i>, Paris, 1752; Escoiquiz,
<i>México Conquistada</i>, 1798; Roux de Rochelle, <i>Ferdinand Cortez</i>; P. du Roure, <i>La Conquête du
Mexique</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the plays,&mdash;Dryden’s <i>Indian Emperor</i> (Cortés and Montezuma); Lope de Vega’s <i>Marquez del
Valle</i>; Fernand de Zarate’s <i>Conquista de México</i>; Canizares, <i>El Pleyto de Fernan Cortes</i>; F. del Rey, <i>Hernand
Cortez en Tabasco</i>; Piron, <i>Cortes</i>; Malcolm MacDonald, <i>Guatemozin</i> (Philadelphia, 1878), etc.</p>

Dr. Kohl’s studies on the course of geographical
discovery along the Pacific coast were
never published. He printed an abstract in the
<i>United States Coast Survey Report</i>, 1855, pp. 374,
375. A manuscript memoir by him on the subject
is in the library of the American Antiquarian
Society (<i>Proceedings</i>, 23 Apr. 1872, pp. 7, 26) at
Worcester. So great advances in this field have
since been made that it probably never will
be printed. There is a chronological statement
of explorations up the Pacific coast in
Duflot de Mofras’ <i>Exploration du territoire de
l’Orégon</i> (Paris, 1844), vol. i. chap. iv.; but H. H.
Bancroft’s <i>Pacific States</i>, particularly his <i>Northwest
Coast</i>, vol. i., embodies the fullest information
on this subject. In the enumeration of
maps in the present paper, many omissions are
made purposely, and some doubtless from want
of knowledge. It is intended only to give a
sufficient number to mark the varying progress
of geographical ideas.</p>

This edition was in small octavo, with sixty
maps, engraved on metal, of which there are
seven of interest to students of American cartography.
They are of South America (no. 54),
New Spain (no. 55), “Terra nova Bacalaos” or
Florida to Labrador (no. 56), Cuba (no. 57),
and Hispaniola (no. 58). The copies in America
which have fallen under the Editor’s observation
are those in the Library of Congress, in the
Astor and Carter-Brown libraries, and in the
collections of Mr. Barlow and Mr. Kalbfleisch
in New York, and of Prof. Jules Marcou in Cambridge.
There was one in the Murphy Collection,
no. 2,067. It is worth from $15 to $25.

The Catalogue of the British Museum puts
under 1562 a map by Furlani called <i>Univerales
Descrittione di tutta la Terra cognosciuta da
Paulo di Forlani</i>. A “carta nautica” of the
same cartographer, now in the Bibliothèque
Nationale at Paris, is figured in Santarem’s <i>Atlas</i>.
(Cf. <i>Bulletin de la Société de Géographie</i>, 1839;
and <i>Studi biografici e bibliografici</i>, ii. p. 142).
Thomassy in his <i>Papes géographes</i>, p. 118, mentions
a Furlani (engraved) map of 1565, published
at Venice, and says it closely resembles
the Gastaldi type. Another, of 1570, is contained
in Lafreri’s <i>Tavole moderne di geografia</i>,
Rome and Venice, 1554-1572 (cf. Manno and
Promis, <i>Notizie di Gastaldi</i>, 1881, p. 19; Harrisse,
<i>Cabots</i>, p. 237). Furlani, in 1574, as we shall
see, had dissevered America and Asia. As to
Diego Hermano, cf. Willes’ <i>History of Trauvayle</i>
(London, 1577) fol. 232, <i>verso</i>.</p>

This expedition of Cortés is not without
difficulties in reconciling authorities and tracing
the fate of the colonists which he sought
to plant at Santa Cruz. Bancroft has examined
the various accounts (<i>North Mexican States</i>, i.

Cortés had called California an island as
early as 1524, in a report to the Emperor, deducing
his belief from native reports. De Laet
in 1633 mentions having seen early Spanish
maps showing it of insular shape.</p>

accounts are not wholly reconcilable. It would
seem probable that Ulloa’s own ship was never
heard from. Ramusio gives a full account (vol.
iii. p. 340) by one of the companions of Ulloa,
on another ship.</p>

At least so says Herrera (Stevens’s edition,
vi. 305). Castañeda defers the naming till Alarcon’s
expedition. Cabrillo in 1542 used the
name as of well-known application. The origin
of the name has been a cause of dispute. Professor
Jules Marcou is in error in stating that
the name was first applied by Bernal Diaz to a
bay on the coast, and so was made to include
the whole region. He claims that it was simply
a designation used by Cortés to distinguish a
land which we now know to be the hottest in the
two Americas,&mdash;Tierra California, derived from
“calida fornax,” fiery furnace. (Cf. <i>Annual
Report of the Survey west of the hundredth Parallel</i>,
by George M. Wheeler, 1876, p. 386; and
<i>Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers</i>, U.S.A.,
1878, appendix, also printed separately as <i>Notes
upon the First Discoveries of California and the
Origin of its Name</i>, by Jules Marcou, Washington,
1878.) Bancroft (<i>California</i>, i. 65, 66) points
out a variety of equivalent derivations which
have been suggested. The name was first traced
in 1862, by Edward E. Hale, to a romance published,
it is supposed, in 1510,&mdash;<i>Las Sergas de
Esplandian</i>, by Garcia Ordoñez de Montalvo,
which might easily enough have been a popular
book with the Spanish followers of Cortés.
There were later editions in 1519, 1521, 1525,
and 1526. In this romance Esplandian, emperor
of the Greeks, the imaginary son of the imaginary
Amadis, defends Constantinople against
the infidels of the East. A pagan queen of Amazons
brings an army of Amazons to the succor
of the infidels. This imaginary queen is named
Calafia, and her kingdom is called “California,”&mdash;a
name possibly derived from “Calif,”
which, to the readers of such a book, would
be associated with the East. California in the
romance is represented as an island rich with
gold and diamonds and pearls. The language
of the writer is this:&mdash;</p>

is an island called California, very close to the side of
the Terrestrial Paradise; and it was peopled by black
women, without any man among them, for they lived
in the fashion of Amazons. They were of strong and
hardy bodies, of ardent courage and great force. Their
island was the strongest in all the world, with its steep
cliffs and rocky shores. Their arms were all of gold,
and so was the harness of the wild beasts which they
tamed to ride; for in the whole island there was no
metal but gold. They lived in caves wrought out of
the rock with much labor. They had many ships, with
which they sailed out to other countries to obtain
booty.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">That this name, as an omen of wealth, struck
the fancy of Cortés is the theory of Dr. Hale,
who adds “that as a western pioneer now gives
the name of ‘Eden’ to his new home, so Cortés
called his new discovery ‘California.’” (Cf.
Hale in <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April 30, 1862;
in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, vi. 312, Oct. 1862; in <i>His
Level Best</i>, p. 234; and in Atlantic Monthly, xiii.
265; J. Archibald in <i>Overland Monthly</i>, ii. 437,
Prof. J. D. Whitney in article “California” in
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>.) Bancroft (<i>North
Mexican States</i>, vol. i. p. 82; and <i>California</i>, vol.
i. p. 64) points out how the earliest use of the
name known to us was in Preciado’s narrative
(Ramusio, vol. iii. p. 343) of Ulloa’s voyage;
and that there is no evidence of its use by Cortés
himself. It was applied then to the bay or
its neighborhood, which had been called Santa
Cruz or La Paz.</p>

second expedition under Alarcon, with a co-operating
fleet to follow the outer coast of the peninsula,
failed of execution. The instructions
given in 1541 to Alarcon for his voyage on the
California coast, by order of Mendoza, are given

The source of our information for this voyage
is a <i>Relacion</i> (June 27, 1542, to April 14,
1543) printed in Pacheco’s <i>Coleccion de documentos inéditos</i>,
xiv. 165; and very little is added
from other sources, given in Bancroft, <i>North
Mexican States</i>, i. 133. Buckingham Smith gave
the <i>Relacion</i> earlier in his <i>Coleccion de varios
Documentos para la historia de la Florida y Tierras
adyacentes</i> (Madrid, 1857, vol. i. p. 173).
A translation is contained in Wheeler’s <i>United
States Geological Survey</i>, vol. vii., with notes, and
an earlier English version by Alexander S. Taylor
was published in San Francisco in 1853, as
<i>The First Voyage to the Coast of California</i>. Cf.
also Bancroft’s <i>California</i>, i. 69; <i>Northwest Coast</i>,
i. 137. It is thought that Juan Paez was the
author of the original, which is preserved among
the Simancas papers at Seville. Herrera seems
to have used it, omitting much and adding somewhat,
thus making the narrative which, till the
original was printed, supplied the staple source
to most writers on the subject. In 1802 Navarrete
summarized the story from this <i>Relacion</i> in
vol. xv. of his <i>Documentos inéditos</i>. Bancroft
(vol. i. p. 81) cites numerous unimportant references.</p>

<i>Nouvelle Espagne</i> (i. 330), where, as well as
in other of the later writers, it is said the name
“Anian” came from one of Cortereal’s companions.
But see H. H. Bancroft, <i>Northwest Coast</i>,
vol. i. pp. 36, 55, 56, where he conjectures
that the name is a confused reminiscence at a
later day of the name of <i>Anus</i> Cortereal, mentioned
by Hakluyt in 1582.</p>

There was at one time a current belief in
the story of a Dutch vessel being driven through
such a strait to the Pacific, passing the great
city of Quivira, which had been founded by the
Aztecs after they had been driven from Mexico
by the Spaniards. Then there are similar stories
told by Menendez (1554) and associated
with Urdaneta’s name (cf. Bancroft, <i>Northwest
Coast</i>, vol. i. p. 51); and at a later day other
like stories often prevailed. The early maps
place the “Regnum Anian” and “Quivira” on
our northwestern coast. Bancroft (<i>Northwest
Coast</i>, vol. i. pp. 45, 49) thinks Gomara responsible
for transferring Quivira from the plains to
the coast. See Editorial Note at the end of
chap. vii.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is sometimes said (see Bancroft, <i>Northwest
Coast</i>, vol. i. p. 55) that the belief in the
Straits of Anian sprang from a misinterpretation
of a passage in Marco Polo; but Bancroft
(p. 53) cannot trace the name back of 1574, as
he finds it in one of the French (Antwerp)
editions of Ortelius of that year. Ortelius had
used the name, however, in his edition of 1570,
but only as a copier, in this as in other respects,
of Mercator, in his great map of 1569, as Bancroft
seems to suspect. Porcacchi (1572), Furlani
or Forlani (1574), and others put the name
on the Asian side of the strait, where it is probable
that it originally appeared. Bancroft (p. 81)
is in error in saying that the name “Anian”
was “for the first time” applied to the north and
south passage between America and Asia, as
distinct from the east and west passage across
the continent, in the “Mercator Atlas of 1595;”
for such an application is apparent in the map
of Zalterius (1566), Mercator (1569), Porcacchi
(1572), Forlani (1574), Best’s Frobisher (1578),&mdash;not
to name others.</p>

This edition, issued at Basle, had twenty
modern maps designed by Münster, two of
which have American interest:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>a.</i> <i>Typus universalis</i>,&mdash;an elliptical map,
showing America on the left, but with a part
of Mexico (Temistitan) carried to the right
of the map, with a strait&mdash;“per hoc fretū iter
patet ad molucas”&mdash;separating America from
India superior on the northwest.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>b.</i> <i>Novæ insulæ</i>,&mdash;the map reproduced in
Vol. IV. p. 41.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are copies of this 1540 edition of
Ptolemy in the Astor Library, in the collections
of Mr. Barlow, Mr. Deane, and President White
of Cornell, while one is noted in the Murphy
Catalogue, no. 2,058, which is now in the library
of the American Geographical Society. This
edition was issued the next year with the date
changed to 1541. Cf. Winsor’s <i>Bibliography of
Ptolemy</i>. The same maps were also used in the
Basle edition of 1542, with borders surrounding
them, some of which were designs, perhaps, of
Holbein. There are copies of this edition in the
Astor Library, and in the collections of Brevoort,
Barlow, and J. H. Trumbull, of Hartford. The
<i>Murphy Catalogue</i> shows another, no. 2,066.</p>

The “Typus universalis” of this edition,
much the same as in the edition of 1540, was
re-engraved for the Basle edition of 1552, with
a few changes of names: “Islandia,” for instance,
which is on the isthmus connecting “Bacalhos”
with Norway, is left out, and so is “Thyle”
on Iceland, which is now called “Island.”
This last engraving was repeated in Münster’s
<i>Cosmographia</i> in 1554.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are copies of the Ptolemy of 1545
in the libraries of Congress and of Harvard
College, and in the Carter-Brown Collection.
One is also owned by J. R. Webster, of East
Milton, Mass., and another is shown in the
<i>Murphy Catalogue</i>, no. 2,078.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Copies of the 1552 edition are in the libraries
of Congress, of New York State, and of
Cornell University. The Sobolewski copy is
now in the collection of Prof. J. D. Whitney,
Cambridge, Mass. Dr. O’Callaghan’s copy
was sold in New York, in December, 1882; the
Murphy copy is no. 2,065 of the <i>Murphy

This map of Homem is given on another
page. His delineation of the gulf seems to be
like Castillo’s, and is carried two degrees too
far north as in that draft; but Castillo’s names
are wanting in Homem, who lays down the
peninsula better, following, as Kohl conjectures,
Ulloa’s charts. He marks the coast above
33° as unknown, showing that he had no
intelligence of Cabrillo’s voyage.</p>

<p class="pfc4">Two of its maps show America, but only
one gives the western coast, while both have
the exaggerated continental Tierra del Fuego.
The map sketched in the text is given in fac-simile
in Stevens’s <i>Notes</i>. Both maps were
repeated in the 1576 edition (Venice, with 1575
in the colophon). This edition shows forty-seven
maps; and pp. 157-184 (third book)
treat of America. Besides a map of the world
it has a “carta da navigar” (p. 198), maps of
Cuba and other islands, and a plan of Mexico
and its lake. There are copies in the Boston
Public and Harvard College libraries, Mr.
Deane’s Collection, etc. Cf. Stevens, <i>Historical

1590. Cf. <i>Boston Public Library Catalogue</i>, no.
6271.14, Carter-Brown, i. 393; Murphy, no.

ii. 40); and in 1620 (Carter-Brown, ii. 241; Cooke,
no. 2,858, now in Harvard College Library),
which was published at Padua, and had maps
of North America (p. 161), Spagnolla (p. 165),
Cuba (p. 172), Jamaica (p. 175), Moluccas
(p. 189), and a mappemonde (p. 193). The last
edition we have noted was issued at Venice
in 1686, with the maps on separate leaves, and
not in the text as previously.</p>

<p class="pfc4">The question of the harbor in which Drake
refitted his ship for his return voyage by Cape
of Good Hope has been examined in another
place (Vol. III. pp. 74, 80). Since that volume
was printed, H. H. Bancroft has published
vol. i. of his <i>History of California</i>; and after
giving a variety of references on Drake’s
voyage (p. 82) he proceeds to examine the
question anew, expressing his own opinion
decidedly against San Francisco, and believing
it can never be settled whether Bodega or the
harbor under Point Reyes (Drake’s Bay of the
modern maps) was the harbor; though on another
page (p. 158) he thinks the spot was
Drake’s Bay, and in a volume previously
issued (<i>Central America</i>, vol. ii. p. 419) he
had given a decided opinion in favor of it.
In his discussion of the question, he claims
that Dr. Hale and most other investigators
have not been aware that the harbor behind
Point Reyes was discovered in 1595 by Cermeñon
(p. 96), and then named San Francisco;
and that it is this old San Francisco, visited
by Viscaino in 1603, and sought by Portolá
in 1769, when this latter navigator stumbled
on the Golden Gate, which is the San Francisco
of the old geographers and cartographers, and
not the magnificent harbor now known by that
name (p. 157). He adds that the tradition
among the Spaniards of the coast has been
more in favor of Bodega than of Drake’s Bay;
while the modern San Francisco has never
been thought of by them. Beyond emphasizing
the distinction between the old and new San
Francisco, Mr. Bancroft has brought no new
influence upon the solution of the question.
He makes a point of a Pacific sea-manual of
Admiral Cabrera Bueno, published at Manilla
in 1734 as <i>Navegacion Especulation</i>, being used
to set this point clear for the first time in English,
when one of his assistants wrote a paper
in the <i>Overland Monthly</i> in 1874. The book
is not very scarce; Quaritch advertised a copy
in 1879 for £4. Bancroft (p. 106) seems to
use an edition of 1792, though he puts the 1734
edition in his list of authorities. Various documents
from the Spanish Archives relating to
Drake’s exploits in the Pacific have been published
(since Vol. III. was printed) in Peralta’s
<i>Costa Rica, Nicaragua y Panamá en el siglo
XVI</i>, Madrid, 1883, p. 569, etc.</p>

It is claimed that Maldonado presented
his memoir in 1609 to the Council of the Indies,
and asked for a reward for the discovery; and
there are two manuscripts purporting to be the
original memoir. One, of which trace is found
in 1672, 1738, 1775, 1781 (copied by Muñoz),
and printed in 1788, was still existing, it is
claimed, in 1789, and was reviewed in 1790
by the French geographer Buache, who endeavored
to establish its authenticity; and it
is translated, with maps, in Barrow’s <i>Chronological
History of Voyages</i>, etc. Another manuscript
was found in the Ambrosian library in 1811,
and was published at Milan as <i>Viaggio dal
mare Atlantico al Pacifico</i>, translated from a
Spanish manuscript (Stevens, <i>Bibliotheca geographica</i>,
no. 1,746), and again in French at
Plaisance in 1812. The editor was Charles
Amoretti, who added a discourse, expressing
his belief in it, together with a circumpolar
map marking Maldonado’s track. (Harvard
College Library, no. 4331.2.) This book was
reviewed by Barrow in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
October, 1816. Cf. Burney’s <i>Voyages</i>, vol. v.
p.167. A memoir by the Chevalier Lapie, with
another map of the “Mer polaire,” is printed in
the <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>, vol. xi.
(1821). Bancroft (<i>Northwest Coast</i>, i. 98) reproduces
Lapie’s map. Navarrete searched the
Spanish Archives for confirmation of this
memoir,&mdash;a search not in vain, inasmuch as
it led to the discovery of the documents with
which he illustrated the history of Columbus;
and he also gave his view of the question in
vol. xv. of his <i>Coleccion de documentos inéditos</i>
in the volume specially called <i>Examen historico-critico
de los Viages y Descubrimientos
apócrifos del capitan Lorenzo Ferrer Maldonado,
de Juan de Fuca y del almirante Bartolomé de
Fonte: memoria comenzada por D. M. F. de
Navarrete, y arreglada y concluida por D.
Eustaquio Fernandez de Navarrete</i>. Bancroft
calls it an elaboration of the voyage of the
<i>Sutil y Méxicana</i>. (Cf. Arcana, <i>Bibliographia
de obras anonimas</i>, 1882, no. 408.) Goldson in
his <i>Memoir on the Straits of Anian</i> places confidence
in the Maldonado memoir. Cf. Bancroft
(<i>Northwest Coast</i>, vol. i. p. 92), who recapitulates
the story and cites the examiners
of it, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, and gives (p. 96) Maldonado’s
map of the strait.</p>

The map of Plancius was first drafted&mdash;according

1594 in the Dutch Linschoten of 1596, where
it was republished. It was re-engraved, but not
credited to Plancius, in the Latin Linschoten
of 1599. The English Linschoten of 1598 has

Cf. nos. 2, 28, 29, 32, 34, 35. This 1597
edition of Ptolemy was issued at Cologne,
under the editing of Jean Antonio Magini,
a Paduan, born in 1556. (Cf. Lelewel, <i>Epilogue</i>,
219.) The maps showing America are,&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">No. 2. A folding map of the two spheres,
drawn by Hieronymus Porro from the map
which Rumoldus Mercator based on his father’s
work.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Nos. 28 and 32. Asia, showing the opposite
American shores.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Nos. 34-35. America, of the Mercator
type, but less accurate than Ortelius. There
are copies of this edition in the library of the
Massachusetts Historical Society, and in Mr.

This and the other maps were repeated
in the six Dutch editions, in the second and
third French, and in the original Latin edition.
The third Dutch edition, in three parts, is the
rarest of the editions in that language; the first
part being without date, while the second and
third are dated respectively 1604 and 1605.
The fourth Dutch edition is dated 1614, the
fifth 1623 (a reprint of the 1614), the sixth
1644 (a reprint of the 1623). Cf. Tiele, <i>Bibliographie

1,883, 1,884.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The English translation by Wolfe (1598)
is mentioned in Vol. III. p. 206. It was so rare
in 1832 that Rich priced it at £8 8<i>s.</i>; and yet
Crowninshield bought his copy in 1844 at a Boston
auction for $10.50. The Roxburgh copy had
brought £10 15<i>s.</i>, and the Jadis copy the same.
Smith, the London dealer, in 1874 advertised
one for £7 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The Menzies copy (no.
1,254) brought $104. There was a copy sold
in the Beckford sale, 1883, no. 1,813, and another
in the Murphy sale, no. 1,498.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The first Latin edition, <i>Navigatio ac Itinerarium</i>,
was printed in 1599, its first part being
translated, with some omissions, from the Dutch,
and the description of America being omitted
from the second part. It was reissued with
a new title in 1614,&mdash;an edition very rare; but
there are copies in the Lenox and Carter-Brown
libraries. Cf. Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 542,
vol. ii. no. 167; Leclerc, no. 360&mdash;150 francs;
Murphy, no. 1,499; Tiele, no. 81; Muller, 1872,

<p class="pfc4">The earliest French edition, <i>Histoire de la
Navigation</i>, etc., bears two different imprints
of Amsterdam, 1610, though it is thought to
have been printed by De Bry at Frankfort. A
second is dated Amsterdam, 1619 (part i.
being after the French edition of 1610, and
parts ii. and iii. being translated from the
Dutch). It has usually appended to it a <i>Description
de l’Amérique</i> (Amsterdam, 1619), pp. 88
and map. America is also described in the
<i>Beschryvinge van verscheyde landen</i> (Amsterdam,
1619), included in the Saegman Collection
(Carter-Brown, vol. ii. no. 1,024). A third
French edition, “augmentée,” but a reprint
of the 1619 edition, appeared at Amsterdam
in 1638. Cf. Carter-Brown, vol. ii. nos. 104,
105, 214, 454; Leclerc, 362 (1610 edition)&mdash;130

edition)&mdash;£8 10<i>s.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4">There are copies of the editions of 1596,
1598, and 1599 in Mr. Deane’s collection. The
Dutch editions are rarely in good condition;
this is said to be on account of the general
use made of them as sea-manuals. The Latin
and German texts in De Bry are not much
prized. (Camus, p. 189; Tiele, p. 90.) Sabin
(<i>Dictionary</i>, vol. x. p. 375) gives the bibliography
of Linschoten. His life is portrayed in Van
Kampen’s <i>Levens van beroemde Nederlanders</i>,
Haarlem, 1838-1840. He was with Barentz on
his first and second Arctic voyages. Cf. <i>Voyagie

Our knowledge of this expedition comes
largely from the account of a Carmelite priest,
Antonio de la Ascension, who accompanied it,
and whose report, presented in the Biblioteca
Nacional at Madrid, is printed in Pacheco’s
<i>Coleccion de documentos</i>, viii. 539. Torquemada
used it, and so did Venegas in his <i>Noticia de la
California</i> (Madrid, 1757; English edition, London,
1759; French edition, Paris, 1767; German,
1769). Cf. on Venegas, Carter-Brown, vol.

Bancroft (<i>Northwest Coast</i>, i. 101) refers to
the suspicions of Father Ascension in 1603, of
Oñate in 1604, and of Nicolas de Cardona in or
about 1617, that California was an island; but
there was on their part no cartographical expression
of the idea.</p>

This Spanish chart here referred to is not
identified, though Delisle credits it&mdash;according
to Bancroft (<i>Northwest Coast</i>, i. 103)&mdash;to Jannson’s
<i>Monde Maritime</i>. If by this is meant
Jannson’s <i>Orbis Maritimus</i>, it was not till 1657
that Jannson added this volume to his edition of
the <i>Mercator-Hondius Atlas</i>. Carpenter’s <i>Geography</i>
(Oxford, 1625) repeats Purchas’s story, and
many have followed it since. In Heylin and
Ogilby, the story goes that some people on the
coast in 1620 were carried in by the current, and
found themselves in the gulf. The Spanish
chart may have been the source of the map in
the Amsterdam <i>Herrera</i> of 1622.</p>

He is particular to describe this ship as
owned by Major Gibbons, who was on board,
and as commanded by one Shapley. Major
Edward Gibbons was a well-known merchant of
Boston at this time, and the story seems first to
have attracted the notice of the local antiquaries
of that city, when Dr. Franklin brought it to the
attention of Thomas Prince; and upon Prince
reporting to him evidence favorable to the existence
of such persons at that time, Franklin addressed
a letter to Dr. Pringle, in which he
considers the story “an abridgment and a translation,
and bad in both respects;” and he adds,
“If a fiction, it is plainly not an English one;
but it has none of the features of fiction.” (Cf.
Sabin’s <i>American Bibliopolist</i>, February, 1870,
p. 65.) Dr. Snow examined it in his <i>History of
Boston</i> (p. 89), and expressed his disbelief in it.
Caleb Cushing in the <i>North American Review</i>
(January, 1839) expressed the opinion that the
account was worthy of investigation; which induced
Mr. James Savage to examine it in detail,
who in the same periodical (April, 1839, p. 559)
set it at rest by at least negative proof, as well
as by establishing an <i>alibi</i> for Gibbons at the
date assigned. It may be remarked that among
the English there was no general belief in a
practicable western passage at this time, and
the directors of the East India Company had
given up the hope of it after Baffin’s return in
1616.</p>

It was very easy for the credulous to identify
the Archipelago of St. Lazarus with the Charlotte
Islands. The map of Delisle and Buache,
published in Paris in 1752 in <i>Nouvelles Cartes des
Découvertes de l’Amiral de Fonte</i>, endeavors to
reconcile the voyages of De Fuca and De Fonte.
The map is reproduced in Bancroft’s <i>Northwest
Coast</i>, i. 128. Under 45° there are two straits
entering a huge inland “mer de l’ouest,” the
southerly of which is supposed to be the one
found by Aguilar in 1603, and the northerly that of
De Fuca in 1592. Under 60° is the St. Lazarus
Archipelago, and thridding the adjacent main are
the bays, straits, lakes, and rivers which connect
the Pacific with Hudson’s Bay. The next year
(1753) Vaugondy, in some <i>Observations critiques</i>,
opposed Delisle’s theory; and the opposing memoirs
were printed in Spanish, with a refutation
of Delisle by Buriel, in Venegas’ <i>California</i>, in
1757. Some years later the English geographer
Jefferys attacked the problem in maps appended
to Dragg’s <i>Great Probability of a Northwest Passage</i>,
which was printed in London in 1768.
Jefferys made the connection with Baffin’s Bay,
and bounded an island&mdash;in which he revived the
old Chinese legend by calling it Fusang&mdash;by
De Fuca’s Straits on the south and De Fonte’s
Archipelago on the north. Foster, in 1786, and
Clavigero, in 1798, repudiated the story; but it
appealed sufficiently to Burney to induce him to
include it in his <i>Chronological History of Voyages
to the South Seas</i>, vol. iii. (1813). William Goldson,
in his <i>Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific,
in two Memoirs on the Straits of Anian and the
Discoveries of De Fonte</i> (Portsmouth, England,
1793), supposed that De Fonte got into the Great
Slave Lake! Navarrete has examined the question
in his <i>Documentos inéditos</i>, xv., as he had
done at less length in his <i>Sutil y Méxicana</i> in 1802,
expressing his disbelief; and so does Bancroft in
his <i>Northwest Coast</i>, i. 115, who cites additionally
(p. 119) La Harpe, <i>Abrégé des Voyages</i> (1816), vol.
xvi., and Lapie, <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>
(1821), vol. xi., as believing the story. A “Chart
for the better understanding of De Font’s letter”
appeared in <i>An Account of a Voyage for
the Discovery of a Northwest Passage</i>, by Theodore
Swaine Drage (clerk of the “California”),
London, 1749, vol. ii.</p>

Sanson adopted it, and it is laid down in
Van Loon’s <i>Zee Atlas</i> of 1661, where, in the chart
“Nova Granada en l’Eylandt California,” it is
marked as the thither shore of the Straits of
Anian, and called “Terra incognita,”&mdash;and Van
Loon had the best reputation of the hydrographers
of his day. The map published by
Thevenot in 1663 also gives it.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Nicolas Sanson died in 1667, and two years
later (1669), his son Guillaume reissued his
father’s map, still with the island and the interjacent
land, which in Blome’s map, published in
his <i>Description</i> (1670), and professedly following
Sanson, is marked “Conibas.” Later, in 1691,
we have another Sanson map; but though the
straits still bound easterly the “Terre de Jesso,”
they are without name, and open easterly into
a limitless “mer glaciale.” Hennepin at a later
day put a special draught of it in the margin of
his large map (1697), where it has something
of continental proportions, stretching through
forty degrees of longitude, north of the thirty-eighth
parallel; and from Hennepin Campanius
copied it (1702) in his <i>Nya Swerige</i>, p. 10, as
shown herewith (p. 464).</p>

<p class="pfc4">It is also delineated in 1700 in the map of
the Dutchman, Lugtenberg. The idea was not
totally given up till Cook’s map of his explorations
in 1777-1778 appeared, which was the first
to give to the peninsula of Alaska and the
Aleutian islands a delineation of approximate
accuracy; and this was fifty years after Behring,
in 1728, had mapped out the Asiatic shore of
this region.</p>

It is worth while to note Virginia Farrer’s
map of Virginia, given in Vol. III. p. 465, for the
strange belief which with some people prevailed
in England in 1651, that the Pacific coast was at
the foot of the western slope of the Alleghanies,&mdash;a
belief which was represented in 1625 by
Master Briggs in Purchas (vol. iii. p. 852), where
he speaks of the south sea “on the other side
of the mountains beyond our falls, which openeth
a free and fair passage to China.”</p>

It was re-engraved in Paris in 1754 by the
geographer Buache, and later in the margin of
a map of North America published by Sayer
of London. It is given in fac-simile in Jules
Marcou’s paper on the first discoverers of California,
appended to the <i>Annual Report of the
Chief of Engineers, U. S. A.</i>, 1878, and is also
sketched in Bancroft’s <i>North Mexican States</i>,
vol. i. p. 499. Cf. his <i>Northwest Coast</i>, vol. i.
pp. 113, 115, 120, where it is shown that Kino
never convinced all his companions that the
accepted island was in fact a peninsula. One
of his associates, Luis Velarde (<i>Documentos
para la historia de México</i>, ser. iv. vol. i. p. 344),
opposed his views. The view is advanced by
E. L. Berthoud in the <i>Kansas City Review</i>
(June, 1883), that a large area between the head
of the gulf and the ocean, now below the sea
level, was at one time covered with water, and
that the island theory was in some way connected
with this condition, which is believed to
have continued as recently as the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.</p>

Bancroft (<i>Northwest Coast</i>, vol. i. pp. 127,

found its way to the sea above the peninsula,
was the last flicker of the belief in the insularity

Delisle was born in 1688 and died in 1747;
Buache lived from 1700 to 1773. Other cartographical
solutions of the same data are found in
William Doyle’s <i>Account of the British Dominions
beyond the Atlantic</i> (London, 1770), and in
the <i>Mémoires sur la situation des pays septentrionaux</i>,
by Samuel Éngel, published at Lausanne
in 1765. Engel’s maps were repeated in a German
translation of his book published in 1772,
and in his <i>Extraits raisonés des Voyages faits dans

There is in the department of State at Washington
a volume of copies from manuscripts
in the hydrographic office at Madrid, attested
by Navarrete, and probably procured by Greenhow
at the time of the Oregon question. It is
called <i>Viages de los Españoles a la costa norveste
de la America en los años de 1774-1775-1779, 1788
y 1790</i>. My attention was drawn to them by

Castañeda, however, relates the circumstances
of Stephen’s death somewhat differently,
stating that the negro and his party, on their arrival
at Cibola, were shut up in a house outside
the city, while for three days the chiefs continued
to question him about the object of his coming.
When told that he was a messenger from two
white men, who had been sent by a powerful
prince to instruct them in heavenly things, they
would not believe that a black man could possibly
have come from a land of white men, and
they suspected him of being the spy of some
nation that wished to subjugate them. Moreover,
the negro had the assurance to demand
from them their property and their women; upon
which they resolved to put him to death, without,
however, harming any of those with him,
all of whom, with the exception of a few boys,
were sent back, to the number of sixty. (<i>Relation</i>,
p. 12.) This latter statement, as well as
that in relation to the libidinous practices of the
negro, are confirmed by Coronado. <i>Relation</i>;

Alarcon set sail on the 9th of May, 1540, and
by penetrating to the upper extremity of the Gulf
of California, proved that California was not an
island, as had been supposed. He made two
attempts to ascend the Colorado in boats, and
planted a cross at the highest point he reached,
burying at its foot a writing, which, as will be
seen, was subsequently found by Melchior Diaz.
His report of this voyage, containing valuable
information in regard to the natives, can be
found in Hakluyt, <i>Voyages</i>, iii. 505 (ed. 1810);
translated from Ramusio, <i>Navigationi</i>, iii. 363
(ed. 1565). There is a French translation in
Ternaux-Compans, ix. 299. This information
about California is supplemented by the narrative
of the voyage made two years later by Juan
Rodriguez Cabrillo along the Pacific shore of
the peninsula, and up the northwest coast probably
as far as the southern border of Oregon.
It was printed in Buckingham Smith’s <i>Coleccion</i>,
p. 173; and subsequently in Pacheco’s <i>Documentos
inéditos</i>, tom. xiv. p. 165. A translation by
Mr. R. S. Evans, with valuable notes by Mr.
H. W. Henshaw, is given in vol. vii. (Archæology)
of <i>United States Geological Survey west of

Chichiltic-calli, or Red House, is generally
supposed to be the ruined structure, called
<i>Casa Grande</i>, in southern Arizona, near Florence,
a little south of the river Gila, and not far
from the Southern Pacific Railroad. But Mr.
A. F. Bandelier, after a thorough topographical
exploration of the regions, is inclined to place
it considerably to the southeast of this point
upon the river Arivaypa, in the vicinity of Fort
Grant. [This question is further examined in
Vol. I. of the present History.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Jaramillo has given a very full itinerary of
this march, describing with great particularity
the nature of the country and the streams crossed
(Ternaux-Compans, ix. 365-369). When the
results of the latest explorations of Mr. A. F.
Bandelier in this region are published by the
Archæological Institute of America, there is
good reason to hope for an exact identification
of most if not all these localities, which at present
is impossible. There can be little doubt,
however, that the Vermejo is the Colorado
Chiquito.</p>

In the <i>Proceedings</i> of the American Antiquarian

the region of the present Zuñi pueblos. Mr.
Frank H. Cushing has made the important discovery
that this tribe has preserved the tradition
of the coming of Fray Marcos, and of the
killing of the negro Stephen, whom they call
“the black Mexican,” at the ruined pueblo
called Quaquima. They claim also to have a
tradition of the visit of Coronado, and even of
Cabeza de Vaca.</p>

Davis (<i>The Spanish Conquest of New Mexico</i>,

the Puerco. But Mr. Bandelier (<i>Historical Introduction</i>,
pp. 20-22), from documentary evidence,
places it higher up the Rio Grande, in
the vicinity of Bernalillo; corresponding perfectly
with the “central point” which Castañeda
declared it to be (p. 182).</p>

Bandelier (<i>Historical Introduction</i>, p. 22)
places Tutahaco in the vicinity of Isleta, on the
Rio Grande, in opposition to Davis’s opinion
(<i>Spanish Conquest</i>, p. 180) that it was at Laguna.
Coronado subsequently sent an officer southward
to explore the country, who reached a
place some eighty leagues distant, where the
river disappeared in the earth, and on his way
discovered four other villages. (Castañeda, p.
140.) These, Bandelier places near Socorro.

In his <i>Letter to Charles V.</i> (p. 358), Coronado
states that having marched forty-two days
after parting from the main body of his force,
he arrived at Quivira in about sixty-seven days
(p. 359). This gives twenty-five days for accomplishing
the distance to the point of separation,
instead of thirty-seven, as stated by
Castañeda (<i>Relation</i>, pp. 127, 134), who estimates
that they had travelled two hundred and
fifty leagues from Tiguex, marching six or seven
leagues a day, as measured by counting their
steps.</p>

<i>Letter to Charles V.</i>, p. 360. There is a
great difference of opinion as to the situation
of Quivira. The earlier writers, Gallatin,
Squier, Kern, Abert, and even Davis, have
fallen into the error of fixing it at Gran Quivira,
about one hundred miles directly south of Santa
Fé, where are to be seen the ruins of a Franciscan
Mission founded subsequently to 1629.
See <i>Diary of an excursion to the ruins of Abo,
Quarra, and Gran Quivira, in New Mexico</i>, 1853,
by Major J. H. Carleton (Smithsonian Report,
1854, p. 296). General Simpson, however,
(<i>Coronado’s March</i>, p. 339) argues against this
view, and maintains that Coronado “reached
the fortieth degree of latitude, or what is now
the boundary line between the States of Kansas
and Nebraska, well on toward the Missouri
River.” Judge Savage believes that he crossed
the plains of Kansas and came out at a point
much farther west, upon the Platte River.
<i>Proceedings of American Antiquarian Society</i>,
April, 1881, p. 240. Prince (<i>History of New
Mexico</i>, p. 141) thinks that “Coronado traversed
parts of the Indian Territory and Kansas, and
finally stopped on the borders of the Missouri,
somewhere between Kansas City and Council
Bluffs.” Judge Prince, who is President of the
Hist. Society of New Mexico, adds that it would
be impossible from what Castañeda tells us, to
determine the position of Quivira with certainty.
Bandelier (<i>Historical Introduction</i>, p. 25) is not
satisfied that he reached as far northeast as

(<i>a</i>) Bartolomé Ruiz, of Moguer, the pilot.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>b</i>) Pedro de Candia, a Greek, who had charge
of Pizarro’s artillery, consisting of two falconets;
an able and experienced officer. After the death
of Pizarro he joined the younger Almagro, who,
suspecting him of treachery, ran him through at
the battle of Chupas. He left a half-caste son,
who was at school at Cusco with Garcilasso de
la Vega.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>c</i>) Cristóval de Peralta, a native of Baeza, in
Andalusia. He was one of the first citizens of
Lima when that city was founded,&mdash;in 1535.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>d</i>) Alonzo Briceño, a native of Benavente.
He was at the division of Atahualpa’s ransom,
and received the share of a cavalry captain.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>e</i>) Nicolas de Ribera, the treasurer, was one
of the first citizens of Lima in 1535. He passed
through all the stormy period of the civil wars
in Peru. He deserted from Gonzalo Pizarro to
the side of the president, Gasca, and was afterwards
captain of the Guard of the Royal Seal.
He is said to have founded the port of San Gallan,
the modern Pisco. Ribera was born at
Olvera, in Andalusia, of good family. He eventually
settled near Cusco, and died, leaving children
to inherit his estates.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>f</i>) Juan de la Torre, a native of Benavente,
in Old Castile. He was a stanch adherent of
Gonzalo Pizarro, and was at the battle of Anaquito,
where he showed ferocious enmity against
the ill-fated viceroy, Blasco Nuñez de Vela. He
married a daughter of an Indian chief near Puerto
Viejo, and acquired great wealth. After the
battle of Sacsahuana, in 1548, he was hanged by
order of the president, Gasca. He was a citizen
of Arequipa, and left descendants there.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>g</i>) Francisco de Cuellar, a native of Cuellar;
but nothing more is known of him.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>h</i>) Alonzo de Molina, a native of Ubeda. He
afterwards landed at Tumbez, where it was arranged
that he should remain until Pizarro’s
return; but he died in the interval.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>i</i>) Domingo de Soria Luce, a native of the
Basque Provinces, probably of Guipuzcoa; but
nothing more is known of him.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>j</i>) Pedro Alcon. He afterwards landed on
the coast of Peru, fell in love with a Peruvian
lady, and refused to come on board again. So
the pilot Ruiz was obliged to knock him down
with an oar, and he was put in irons on the lower
deck. Nothing more is known of him.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>k</i>) Garcia de Jerez (or Jaren). He appears
to have made a statement on the subject of the
heroism of Pizarro and his companions, Aug.
3, 1529, at Panamá. <i>Documentos inéditos, tom.</i>
xxvi. p. 260, quoted by Helps, vol. iii. p. 446.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>l</i>) Anton de Carrion. Nothing further is
known of him.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>m</i>) Martin de Paz. Nothing further is known
of him.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>n</i>) Diego de Truxillo (Alonzo, according
to Zarate). He was afterwards personally known
to Garcilasso at Cusco. He appears to have
written an account of the discovery of Peru,
which is still in manuscript. <i>Antonio</i>, ii. 645;
also, <i>Leon Pinelo</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>o</i>) Alonzo Ribera (or Geronimo) was settled
at Lima, where he had children.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>p</i>) Francisco Rodriguez de Villa Fuerte was
the first to cross the line drawn by Pizarro. He
was afterwards a citizen of Cusco, having been
present at the siege by the Ynca Manco, and at
the battle of Salinas. Garcilasso knew him, and
once rode with him from Cusco to Quispicanchi,
when he recounted many reminiscences of his
stirring life. He was still living at Cusco in 1560,
a rich and influential citizen. [Mr. Markham has
given the number as sixteen in his <i>Reports on the
Discovery of Peru</i>, p. 8, together with his reasons
for it, which do not commend themselves, however,
to Kirk, the editor of Prescott (<i>History of
the Conquest of Peru</i>, edition of 1879, i. 303).
Helps dismisses the story of the line as the
melodramatic effort of a second-rate imagination.

[Atahualpa was hurriedly tried on the
charge of assassinating Huascar and conspiring
against the Spaniards. Oviedo speaks of the
“villany” of the transaction. Cf. Prescott, <i>History
of the Conquest of Peru</i>, vol. i. p. 467. Pizarro’s
secretary, Xeres, palliates the crime as being
committed upon “the greatest butcher that the
world ever saw.”</p>
<p class="pfc4">Prescott (<i>Peru</i>, ii. 473, 480) prints several
of the contemporary accounts of the seizure
and execution of Atahualpa. He says that
Garcilasso de la Vega “has indulged in the
romantic strain to an unpardonable extent in his
account of the capture; ... yet his version has
something in it so pleasing to the imagination,
that it has ever found favor with the majority of
readers. The English student might have met
with a sufficient corrective in the criticism of
the sagacious and sceptical Robertson.” There
are the usual stories of a comet at the time of
the death of the Ynca. Cf. Humboldt, <i>Views

They are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>a</i>) Hernando de Soto, the explorer of
Florida and discoverer of the Mississippi.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>b</i>) Francisco de Chaves, a native of Truxillo.
He was murdered at Lima, in 1541, in attempting
to defend the staircase against the assassins of
Pizarro. Zarate says that when he died he was
the most important personage in Peru, next to
Pizarro.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>c</i>) Diego de Chaves, brother of Francisco,
whose wife, Maria de Escobar, introduced the
cultivation of wheat into Peru.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>d</i>) Francisco de Fuentes, in the list of those
who shared the ransom.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>e</i>) Pedro de Ayala.
Diego de Mora, afterwards settled at
Truxillo on the coast of Peru. The president,
Gasca made him a captain of cavalry, and he
was subsequently corregidor of Lima.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>g</i>) Francisco Moscoso.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>h</i>) Hernando de Haro, taken prisoner by
the Ynca Titu Atauchi, but treated kindly.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>i</i>) Pedro de Mendoza, in the list of those
who shared the ransom.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>j</i>) Juan de Rada, a stanch follower of
Almagro. He accompanied his chief on his
expedition to Chili, and avenged his death by
the assassination of Pizarro.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>k</i>) Alonzo de Avila.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(<i>l</i>) Blas de Atienza was the second man
who ever embarked on the Pacific, when he
served under Vasco Nuñez de Balbóa in 1513.
He settled at Truxillo; and his daughter Inez
accompanied Pedro de Ursua in 1560 in his ill-fated
expedition to discover El Dorado. His son
Blas was a friar, who published a book called

[It will be remembered that the original
Bull of 1493 fixed the meridian 100 leagues (say
400 miles) west of the Azores or Cape De Verde
Islands, supposing them to lie north and south of
each other; whereas the limit in force after June
7, 1494, was 370 leagues (say 1,080 miles) west
of the Azores, since Portugal, complaining of
the first limit, had negotiated with Spain for a
new limit, the Pope assenting; and this final
limit was confirmed by a convention at Tordesillas

But the word <i>hamac</i> is Haytian, not Brazilian.
The hammock itself had been noticed
by Columbus. Peter Martyr describes it, and
Oviedo figures it in narrating the second voyage.

Which they called <i>boi</i>, according to Pigafetta;
but this name has not been traced
since his time. The Brazilian name of house
was <i>oca</i>. Of twelve “Brazilian” words given
in Pigafetta, five found their way into European
languages. But, oddly enough, three
of these were not Brazilian, but were “ship-language,”
and borrowed from the West Indies.
These are <i>cacich</i> for “king,” <i>hamac</i> for “bed,”
<i>maiz</i> for “millet;” perhaps <i>canot</i> is to be added.
But <i>Setebos</i>, the name of their god or devil, is
Pigafetta’s own. Shakspeare was struck by it,
and gives it to Caliban’s divinity.</p>

[Cf. note on the alleged height of the
Patagonians in Thevet’s <i>La France antarctique</i>,
Gaffarel’s ed., p. 287. Schouten testifies to
finding bones in a grave ten feet and more of
stature; and Pernetty’s <i>Voyage aux Isles Malonines</i>
(Paris, 1770) gives the testimony of an
engraving to their large stature (Field, <i>Indian
Bibliography</i>, no. 1,200). There is a cut of two
enormous Patagonians standing beside a European
in Don Casimiro de Ortega’s <i>Resumen
histórico del primer viage hecho al rededor del
mundo, emprendido por Hernando de Magallanes</i>
(Madrid, 1769). Statements of their unusual
height have been insisted upon even in our day
by travellers. One of the most trustworthy
of recent explorers (1869-1870) of Patagonia,
Lieutenant G. C. Musters, says that the men
average six feet, some reaching six feet four
inches; while the average of the women is five
feet four.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

Pigafetta has preserved the vocabulary of
ninety words which in this way he made. The
words, he says, are to be pronounced in the
throat. A few of the words are these: Ears,
<i>sanc</i>; eyes, <i>ather</i>; nose, <i>or</i>; breast, <i>othey</i>;
eyelids, <i>sechechiel</i>; nostrils, <i>oresche</i>; mouth,
<i>piam</i>; a chief, <i>hez</i>.</p>

This might have been inferred from Pigafetta’s
map of the strait, in which the western
shore of Patagonia and Chili are well laid in;
but that inference seems to have escaped the

Most observers forget, however, when they
look upon a map of this ocean, that the name of
an island or group upon the map may cover a
hundred, not to say a thousand, times as much
space on the paper as the island or group takes
up on the surface of the world. Dr. Charles
Darwin calls attention to such forgetfulness, in
the <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>.</p>

He died in 1534. A brother-in-law of Magellan,
Duarte Barbosa, who was killed at the
same time with his chief, prepared a manuscript
in 1516, which was printed by Ramusio in Italian
as <i>Sommario di tutti li regni dell’Indie orientali</i>.
This paper, describing from such sources as were
available the eastern regions, had not a little
influence on Magellan. The original Portuguese
was printed by the Lisbon Academy in their
<i>Noticias Ultramarinhas</i>, in 1813.</p>

All three of these editions are in the Lenox
Library, and the first two are in the Carter-Brown.
Cf. Harrisse, <i>Bibl. Amer. Vet.</i>, nos. 122,
123, 124. Leclerc priced the Cologne edition at
500 francs, and the Rome (1523) at 350. <i>Bibl.
Amer. Vet.</i> nos. 376, 377. Dufossé (nos. 11,003,
12,348) puts the Cologne edition at 500 francs,
and again (no. 14,892) at 380. The <i>Court Catalogue</i>
(Paris, 1884) shows the Cologne edition
(no. 220) and the Rome (1524) edition (no. 221).
Brunet is in error in calling the Roman edition
the earliest. A Cologne copy in the Murphy
sale (1884) brought $75; <i>Catalogue</i>, no. 2,519.
One in F. S. Ellis’s <i>Catalogue</i> (1884), no. 188,
is priced at £42. Cf. Sabin, xi. 47,038-47,042;

in Ramusio (i. 347); in Spanish, in Navarrete

Among them may be mentioned, for instance,
such books as Argensola’s <i>Conquista de
las islas Malucas</i>, Madrid, 1609, which a hundred
years later was made familiar to French and
English readers by editions at Amsterdam in
1707, and by being included in Stevens’s <i>Collection
of Voyages</i> in 1708, while the German version
appeared at Frankfort in 1711 (cf. Carter-Brown,
ii. 77; iii. 92, 104, 119, 147); Gotard
Arthus’s <i>India Orientalis</i>, Cologne, 1608; Farya
y Sousa’s <i>Asia Portuguesa</i>, Lisbon, 1666-1675.
The final conquest of the Philippines was not
accomplished till 1564, when by order of Philip
II., Miguel Lopez de Legaspi led a fleet from
Navidad in New Spain. For this and the subsequent
history of the island see Antonio de
Morga’s <i>Philippine Islands</i> (Mexico, 1609) as
translated and annotated for the Hakluyt Society

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
